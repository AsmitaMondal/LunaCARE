## üè∑Ô∏è What Does LunaCare Stand For?

- **Luna**: Derived from the Latin word for the moon, symbolizing the natural cycles that mirror a woman's body, just like lunar phases.
- **Care**: Represents the compassion, support, and personalized resources LunaCare provides to ensure every woman feels empowered in her health journey.



## üí° Why LunaCare?

Women's menstrual health is a critical aspect of overall well-being, yet it remains an 
often overlooked area in healthcare. Many women struggle to find reliable, accurate, and 
accessible information regarding their menstrual cycles, leading to confusion and potential 
health risks. Conditions such as Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) are prevalent, but 
they are frequently misunderstood, underdiagnosed, or mismanaged. This gap in 
understanding can result in women feeling overwhelmed and unsupported in managing 
their symptoms, which further complicates their healthcare journey.

## üåö Why Choose the Moon as Symbolic Referance?

The moon, with its cyclical phases, has long been a symbol of feminine energy and natural rhythms. Just as the moon waxes and wanes, so too does the menstrual cycle. This celestial body, with its mysterious glow and profound influence on tides, serves as a powerful metaphor for the ebb and flow of a woman's body and emotions. By aligning our menstrual care website with the themes of the moon, we aim to create a space that is both informative and empowering, celebrating the natural beauty and wisdom of the female experience.
