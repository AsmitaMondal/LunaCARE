            <h2>Introduction to Puberty</h2>
            <p>Puberty is the phase of life when a child's body begins to develop and change as they transition into adulthood. This phase usually starts between the ages of 8 and 14 and involves a series of physical, emotional, and psychological changes. These changes are driven by the body's production of hormones, which leads to the development of secondary sexual characteristics such as breast development, pubic hair growth, and the start of menstruation in those assigned female at birth.</p>

            <p>Understanding the changes during puberty can be empowering, as it helps young people navigate this critical stage with confidence. This guide aims to provide a clear and comprehensive overview of what to expect during puberty, particularly focusing on menstruation.</p>

            <h2>When Does Menstruation Typically Begin?</h2>
            <p>Menstruation usually begins between the ages of 10 and 16, typically starting around 2 to 3 years after the onset of puberty. The average age for the first period, known as menarche, is about 12 years old. However, it's normal for some to start as early as 8 or as late as 16. Menstruation is a key sign that the body is maturing and that the reproductive system is becoming functional.</p>

            <h2>Understanding Your Menstrual Cycle</h2>
            <p>The menstrual cycle is a natural, monthly process that the body goes through in preparation for a potential pregnancy. The cycle is controlled by hormones and typically lasts between 21 and 35 days, with an average of 28 days. Each cycle begins on the first day of your period and ends the day before your next period starts.</p>

            <h3>Phases of the Menstrual Cycle</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Menstrual Phase:</strong> This is the period itself, lasting from 3 to 7 days. The uterus sheds its lining, resulting in menstrual bleeding.</li>
                <li><strong>Follicular Phase:</strong> Starting from the first day of menstruation, this phase lasts until ovulation. The body prepares an egg for release, and the uterine lining begins to thicken.</li>
                <li><strong>Ovulation:</strong> Typically occurring around day 14 of a 28-day cycle, ovulation is the release of an egg from the ovary. This is the most fertile phase of the cycle.</li>
                <li><strong>Luteal Phase:</strong> After ovulation, the body prepares for a potential pregnancy. If the egg is not fertilized, the lining of the uterus begins to break down, leading to menstruation.</li>
            </ul>
