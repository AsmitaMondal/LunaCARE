 },
 {
  "instruction (string)": "what are the phases of menstrual cycle",
  "output (string)": "The menstrual cycle consists of four main phases: the follicular phase, ovulation, the luteal phase, and menstruation. During the follicular phase, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) stimulates follicles in the ovary to mature. Ovulation occurs when a mature egg is released from the ovary. The luteal phase follows ovulation, during which the ruptured follicle forms the corpus luteum and secretes progesterone. If fertilization does not occur, the uterine lining sheds during menstruation, marking the end of the cycle."
 },
 {

During ovulation, emphasize foods high in antioxidants like berries and vegetables to support egg health. In the luteal phase, include calcium-rich foods like dairy and leafy greens to ease premenstrual symptoms. Stay hydrated and limit caffeine and processed foods throughout the cycle for overall health."
 },
 {
  "instruction (string)": "what is the ideal exercise for each phase of menstrual cycle",
  "output (string)": "The ideal exercise varies across the phases of the menstrual cycle. During the follicular phase (days 1-14), low to moderate intensity aerobic exercises like walking, cycling, and swimming are beneficial as estrogen levels rise, enhancing energy levels and endurance. In the ovulatory phase (around day 14), high-intensity interval training (HIIT) or strength training can be effective, capitalizing on peak energy and strength levels. In the luteal phase (days 15-28), focusing on yoga, Pilates, and lower-intensity workouts helps manage premenstrual symptoms and stress, while supporting the body's natural hormonal shifts. Listening to the body's cues and adjusting intensity accordingly is key throughout the cycle."

  "instruction (string)": "Are sanitary products bad for your health?",
  "output (string)": "In general, no. However, there are possible health impacts to consider.  Use of highly absorbent tampons has been associated with toxic shock syndrome (TSS), a life-threatening condition, but these cases are rare. Frequently changing tampons greatly lowers the risk of TSS.  People with sensitive skin may have reactions to the materials used in sanitary products, such as the fragrances used in some pads. \nIn addition, many countries do not obligate manufacturers to disclose the ingredients or components of sanitary products, which could lead to women being exposed to unwanted materials. Some tampon brands, for instance, contain chemicals like dioxins. There has been little research to determine the health consequences, if any, caused by exposure to these chemicals."
 },
 {
  "instruction (string)": "Is menstruation bad for the environment?",
  "output (string)": "No, menstruation in itself is not bad for the environment. However, products used to manage menstruation can have a negative impact on the environment, depending on the product and the way it is disposed. Sanitary products such as tampons and pads often contain plastics and chemicals that are bad for the environment. The time it takes for them to degrade in a landfill is centuries longer than the lifespan of a woman. Sanitary products can also be found in bodies of water and along shorelines. The manufacturing process to produce sanitary products also has environmental consequences. More environmentally friendly options include reusable menstrual cups as well as reusable and\/or biodegradable pads. "

 {
  "instruction (string)": "Can a person get pregnant during menstruation?",
  "output (string)": "Yes. It is widely believed that intercourse during menstruation cannot result in pregnancy. However, this is not true for women and girls with shorter or irregular menstrual cycles. Non-menstrual vaginal bleeding may also be mistaken for menstruation, which can convey a false sense of security against pregnancy. The only reliable way to prevent pregnancy is to use a modern form of contraception."
 },
 {
  "instruction (string)": "Does menstruation limit what people can do?",
  "output (string)": "No. While menstruation has been used throughout history to exclude women and girls from all kinds of roles and settings, there is really nothing that menstruating people cannot do. Exercise, swimming, bathing, work and sex are all possible during menstruation. In some cultures, there are restrictions on what people can do during menstruation, but these are customs, beliefs and traditions and have nothing to do with people’s actual abilities. Menstruating women can – and have – competed in the Olympics, run marathons, traveled to space, held leadership roles, served as judges and held religious offices. "
 },
 {
  "instruction (string)": "What are positive aspects of menstruation?",
  "output (string)": "Regular menstruation can be an indication that a woman’s reproductive health is on track. It can help women understand and, in a general way, monitor their fertility. For instance, many women regard their monthly period as an indication that they are not pregnant. (This method is not foolproof, however, since even pregnant women can experience bleeding, such as implantation bleeding). "
 },
 {
  "instruction (string)": "Can you give an example of menstrual tradition's impact?",
  "output (string)": "Some traditions offer menstruating women and girls a chance to bond with one another. In Rajasthan, India, where menstruation can restrict women’s and girls’ activities, recently married women may use it as an opportunity to visit their maternal families. Menstruation can also be an opportunity to take a break from regular responsibilities. "
 },
 {
  "instruction (string)": "What is period poverty?",
  "output (string)": "Period poverty describes the struggle many low-income women and girls face while trying to afford menstrual products. The term also refers to the increased economic vulnerability women and girls face due the financial burden posed by menstrual supplies. These include not only sanitary napkins and tampons, but also related costs such as pain medication and underwear. Period poverty does not only affect women and girls in developing countries; it also affects women in wealthy, industrialized countries. "
 },
 {
  "instruction (string)": "How does period poverty affect women?",
  "output (string)": "Difficulty affording menstrual products can cause girls to stay home from school and work, with lasting consequences on their educations and economic opportunities. It can also exacerbate existing vulnerabilities, pushing women and girls closer toward dangerous coping mechanisms. Studies in Kenya, for example, have shown that some schoolgirls have engaged in transactional sex to pay for menstrual products."
 },
 {
  "instruction (string)": "Is period poverty just an economic issue?",
  "output (string)": "Period poverty is not only an economic issue, but a social and political one as well. For instance, some advocates have called for menstruation products to be taxation exempt. Such efforts in India have resulted in the elimination of tax on sanitary pads and tampons."

 },
 {
  "instruction (string)": "Is the onset opf periods earlier than it used to be?",
  "output (string)": "Some studies have found that menarche is occurring earlier among girls in certain places, often in high-income countries and communities. Research from countries such as South Africa suggest these changes are related to nutrition and socio-economic status, meaning that as nutrition and health improve, girls’ bodies may mature slightly earlier. However, lack of systematically collected data from low-income countries means that broader or global conclusions cannot be made. "
 },
 {
  "instruction (string)": "What is menarche?",

 {
  "instruction (string)": "What are fibroids?",
  "output (string)": "Fibroids are lumpy growths in the uterus.Human rights are rights that every human being has by virtue of his or her human dignity. Menstruation is intrinsically related to human dignity – when people cannot access safe bathing facilities and safe and effective means of managing their menstrual hygiene, they are not able to manage their menstruation with dignity. Menstruation-related teasing, exclusion and shame also undermine the principle of human dignity. Gender inequality, extreme poverty, humanitarian crises and harmful traditions can all turn menstruation into a time of deprivation and stigma, which can undermine their enjoyment of fundamental human rights."
