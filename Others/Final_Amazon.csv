option in the market. beginner friendly and better price. . ignoring the reviews about application i bought it but believe me it’s useless . it’s third day am not able to use campan with application. in my st use i didn t like the product much as i didn t read the product description on how to use it. i thought the application is small.nnut thankfully i read the description.nnow i swear by this product.ngirls go for it. not worth the price other bands are more useful than this.ncannot bear normal flow. product is good and easy to use and safe for hygienic i use iron campan with applications for the past one year.no. easy to insert.no. very comfortable.no. absorb well. for better protection one can use party liners.no. very campan comes with a individual plastic wrap. to easy to carry.no. the cotton quality is excellent.nno. i ve no complaint against my previous purchases but this time i got the box with broken seal picture is attached . it s clearly visible that someone tempered the box. to keep the hygienic thing in mind i want a replacement with a fresh sealed box of campan. please amazon i need a replacement. i thought application tampons are not leak proof. it came mostly from my experience of using of application tampons. but this one is leak proof and comes with a plastic application that makes it so easy to use without the messiness of having to use your finger to push the campan in place. i saw some people are complaining that the application is too short but i didn t feel that it worked perfectly for me. i have used both the regular flow and heavy flow ones. i really wanted to give this six stars since i already gave of and of five stars. o of god i can t even tell how happy i am with this. today is the first time i ve used this product and i can t feel any discomfort. the ones i used before did not come with the application and it was difficult for me to use. or may be i did not insert it properly. but this his is so good. to efforts needed nothing. to easy and so comfortable. thank you for this product.nno.s. i ll soon start using the cups because of how co friendly it. i started with tampons to get used to it as i m someone who always used pads. i have been using these tampons for a while now it has made my life so much more easy i m surely donna buy it again definitely recommend buying. when i tried to insert the campan the plunged didn t move smoothly to push the campan in and i had to try again with a different campan. when the campan did go in it didn t go far enough in i did feel a bit of discomfort. i think of tampons are much better. it first i wasted 6 tampons co the campan was too tight and didn completely go out of the application tube which got stuck half way. however later i figured it out. you have to pull out the inner tube so that it can push the whole of the campan out of the application. the application quality is top notch. the campan lasts for around 5 hours for regular flow which is perfect and quality is really good. i am going to order for sure to for it.used to use tampons without applications.but after using it.no going back.also using heavy ones for heavy days .nnot: just follow the method given on the pack to the word and it will be super easy for anyone trying to use it. it only stays for 3 4 his even on normal flow days. after that you need to change it. good only for the ones having light flow great one for days 1 3 and 4. on t feel like wearing anything. to discomfort at all for day 2 and more heavier flow days use their super heavy low pack.cannot imagine life without tampons now terrible. the application does not release the campan so it is as good as not having an application. letter not order this product. i’ve been using tampons for long but this one is super disappointing. the application is worst. haste of money. cry soft or campan. the quality is superb. n u dint had to worry at all.no leakage or stain on clothes. u can go for it girls. just keep it changing according to or flow. easy to use but it came opened good too thick for regular flow. b regular is better the campan doesn t leave the application. very easy to use and comfortable. been using it for last 4 months and faced no issues whatsoever. good campan does not leave the application easily extremely difficult to use if not familiar. the application doesn’t work it’s useless expensive. totally waste of money good product impressive quality. used this brand for the first time and loved it. packing is very unique easy to carry. to absorbent at all. i went for a run and wasted. useful for the last lightest flow. applicators are the worst ever application:person facepalming:u200d:female sign::person facepalming:u200d:female sign: never recommended anyone the packet was open like this and one campan was missing. please revert back haste of money. spend more money buy playtex tampons. available here ibhejo also. this of of good absolutely useless application i ordered these after much research with reviews but so upsetting to receive such a badly designed product. why the price of this is so high compared to soft tampons which is made in japan.aren t we concerned regarding the ladies affordability range along with nature friendly option co it s our basic need had i use campan regularly but decided to give iron a try and i am not disappointed. it waters to my very heavy flow. easy to use and comfortable. i love this product. very happy with the product. the application makes it much easier to insert and there are no leakage. i ran swam and

easy. product delivery took too long. i ve got no complaints about this.nor people who have menorrhagia you might end up changing it every 2 hours but still it s worth the comfort till then.nor best experience use a party line with your tampons always period make easy easy to use it s best as compared to cup. to use tampons instead of pads is one of my best decision i ve ever made.my periods are irritation free rashes free mess free nd also tension free no odor no leakage .:partying face:now once again i m going to order it .hurrah good i wanted to try a campan for 2 reasons :no. i was sick of using sanitary pads that offer zero comfort and leave rashes on the butt.no. i wanted to be able to go to grm and do all the exercises without a thing sticking to my butt.nno m writing this review after using of pro comfort tampons heavy flow for a few months. i m not going back to using pads again unless absolutely required .like any other girl using a campan for the first time i too was a little skeptically about inserting a blood sucking things in my body. of you don t have cramps during your periods there are chances you could forget you are on your periods that s how comfortable this thing is. it s extremely easy to use it has detailed instructions in the box. of you feel it slipping downwards chances are you haven t inserted well enough. all you need to do it push it deeper. there is no odour and it s so tiny that you can just wrap it in a small piece of paper and dispose it easily.no would recommend changing the campan every 4 5 hours if the flow is heavy it won t survive for 8 hours like mentioned on the box. of you are going to have a day out you might have to be extra careful.not procomfort has solved both my problems. it s like a wish come true. good product the product is so comfortable that my periods feel non extent now. easy to insert small and compact so doesn t cause any discomfort excellent absorbent and lasts about 4 hours during heaviest flow and about 6 hours during moderate flow days. i thought removal might become mess but no the absorbent is so good that there was 0 mess during removal. it even shortened the duration of my period 6 days became 4 days now as it absorb directly from the source. i was afraid to ride a cycle with it inserted thought it might cause discomfort but it s so small that i didn t even feel it inside. i ve completely switched to of tampons no more itchy pads. for heavy flow it works good unto 6 to his and for average or regular flow it works unto his or more but obviously one should change this after every the to maximum his. everything fine his thing is honestly life changing. i have never felt happier after using a campan. it s literally the best thing ever and i advise each and every girl/woman to try this. it would be worth it. also i think u shed put it in in squatting position cos it gets in very easily. i have medium flow and it stayed for at least 6 hours with 0 leakage. it s honestly the best thing ever. to more rashes or itching or gross smell staining that those nasty papa give. the o.b product is very god just go for it vigour a second thought. i have used the average flow campan for the first time and i m in love did it. the product absorbancy is very god nd very easy to use days y i ordered heavy flow . tz very haste free nd after using it u forget dat u r on or periods. i m a beginner and more than satisfied did o.b tampons. i have to try these heavy flow one. these were the first tampons i used and i got converted used them for long and only recently experimented with other bands. i think it suffices to say i have experimented enough and have gotten back to these the best ones good product mind blowing product. i use menstrual cup from past 1 or but this time i ordered tampons. i felt really comfortable. i didn t feel like i am on my period. in menstrual cup i am always self conscious but this tampons are amazing.not s absolutely easy to insert and extract.the absorbency is great i ordered the super heavy flow so it lasted perfectly for his and then started leaking so it s absolutely fine. have been using since last 5 years. easy to insert and remove. takes life much better. good absorbent depending on the flow. have had episodes of overflow within 3 4 hours being a heavy bleeder. letter to have a back. to for it. it’s a good product. good for heavy bleeding days. stay tension free. these are the only one which are decent in india. they absorb blood quickly and are comfortable. the only problem is that sometimes cotton in them comes out and then it goes to waste can t use them after that. perfect campan for those who have heavy flow.its absorbent is so far better than any other tampons course its easy to use.i do recommend this.wont be scared just go for it the one who is using first just give a try.once u are done u ll be feeling really :thumbs up: good good maintain promise i found this to be very useful and convenient substitute for pads. i have been using this for the last 2 year. for the first 3 days i use tampons only and i don t even worry about those days now. i found that the use of tampons reduce the duration of these days which is very good. its easy to insert after first few attempts. on t have to worry about leakage. an use super and regular according to the flow. for me super last for about 7 8 his and regular 5 6 his on an average. a pantyliner can be used as an added precaution in case you are worried about leakage if not able to change it on time. i don t worry about long trips or outing now. earlier i had to plan everything in advance. now i am so happy and not gathered about periods. safe and moderate . jacket is dipped in oil . his is the very first time.i used tendons .nut definitely a best decision. before using i had so many doubts and were too scared. but this is actually very easy to use. u will not feel any kind of discomfort. girls go for it. the product is far as usual good absorbent easy to use. but this time packing was too good. the product was not damage at all last time it was. one must give it a try. its a life changing thing for women west campan if you hate pads . to problem at all. using it for more than 5 years now. the description says it s for heavy flow. i feel the word is relative. it lasted for 1 1.5 his during my st two days. otherwise it s comfortable easy to use and soft. the packing individually is good. good for someone in sports. would definitely recommend. his blessing in disguise:smiling face with hearts: i don t use tampons but this product really give me hope :smiling face with open hands:to try as the price was okay with the quality of product this:nerd face:. i feel free with this product believe me or not best 4 days of my periods till now because i thought it is worth trying once :folded hands::folded hands::folded hands::thumbs up: to doubt o.b. tampons are easy and continent to use but according to the research it is found that tampons leads to atoxic shock syndrome tss disease and there is no aliment to cure tss. use when required i.e swimming and avoid using it while sleeping. to added fragrance that s why i loved it lasted me for 7 hours i wish i knew about this product when i started using pads . i m in lui with tampons now . it s really easy to use and no leakage . however it depend on or flow . to rashes this the best part . his campan brand is just awesome. but my recommendation is that avoid the heavy flow one as you will feel this is drying inside. always go for medium absorbent and change it every 4 6 hours. heavy one is useful for the first two days though. used tampons for the first time. looks intimidating but very good to use. it s hygienic but you need to use a pad for heavy flow days to avoid leakage. it did reduce a day of my heavy periods. i use up to 3 tampons for first second day and am almost dry the third day as it oaks up all the blood right from the croix. all you need is to go through the instructions and get the hang of it. initially it was hurting because i didn t push it really deep where it s almost as if nothing s inside you. would highly recommend. must try if you still haven t. you won t be disappointed for sure. his is very reasonable for this quality. thumbs up from me i bought the same product from my local medical and believe the one which i got from amazon is a low grade quality campan. since it is a matter of my personal hygienic i prefer buying it from my local medical store. for the first times once you get the hang of it the he it s pretty miraculous.andros:no.that icy wet feeling of pads goneno. you won t know it s there if placed properlyno. to portable noneno. have to change after seeing each time i don t know if it s possible to not do so so if or bladder is small enoughno. cramps. holy cramps.no. u do need party liners.nut all in all i urge you to try this. of you are young pus do read up on their sizes before buying them. oh my god i always hated my period ever since it started. lads were mess icy and caused rashes. and the odor after the menstruation was disgusting. to i thought of giving a try to tampons. by seeing the reviews here i ordered these of tampons. and the moment i started using them i am completely in love with the product. these tampons are great. must insert them inside and forget about having your period at all. to leakage. to discomfort. must makes me feel dry and comfortable throughout the day and night. i would recommend this to every girl. to for it. it s comfortable and so easy to use don t think too much just go for it by first purchase of tampons after reading reviews i thought of giving it a tryn.its very good to use and one dint he to worry or any kind of stains.i wore a pad along bc i was earlier not clear of it mud give haste free periods or of. it my pad went clean all d time.only who campan s full n any to change gives a stain on thread f campan n its d time to change. for of protection i think i of try party line next time ought them and wished why i didn t start using them before. tampons are definitely comfortable than pads and can be easily carried around .nnull those pp who complain that they cannot sit comfortably and all please read the instructions.nnip:of you re one of those people who cannot sit properly or feel uncomfortable that means your campan is only half way in .rush it in you won t feel any discomfort. it gives complete freedom from all problems of menstruation. his is the first product i shifted when moved from sanitary pads to tampons. it is very good fits comfortably and great for heavy flow days but you ll have to change it every 4 to 5 hours. letter than sanitary pads any day. must to have itemeasy to usenineresults are excellent after using u will forget the u r in period seriously girls go for it :thumbs up: these tampons are soft to the sensitive skin easy to use. once inserted you just forget about it. i had to keep reminders to change my tampons every 4 6 his. the best tampons ever. perfect in size n i know its without application but the good thing is that i can use without application and you can see that the tampons if its good or anything wrong with it. well its just my point of view of hygienic after reading a news about note tendon in application was infected with fungus. his product changed my life. but then this is the only brand of campan i tried aside from of. it has great absorbent. i use it for day one and two and even wear it to sleep at night. i think it s a must buy unless someone has some other suggestion. its too comfortable to use.worth to buy excellent product and good service.when it comes to product. it says you need to change after 4 6 his. but i have heavy flow and the camp could not stand for more than 2 1/2 his. accepted i had most hygienic periods of my life. a good product and i love to use it.thanks amazon i love them. they are so easy to use and adapt to if you are a pad user. regular was available in all shops even those which were not chemists but this was not. i used them in the first few days and switched to regular later on. to need to wear sanitary napkins if you change regularly at home. take precautions when outside in a social setting as the campan cannot hold beyond its capacity. the string is useful to push aside. never exceed its limit by using longer than prescribed. received an open box. unhappy. but i love these tampons. been using them for a couple of years now. his particular one is to be used in the heavy days only although it says super. it can be used on regular days as well but for a longer duration. for heavy flow days it lasts about 5 hours. but good stuff. to leakage. i was very apprehensive of shifting from of to tampons but this is the best experience ever and i have had heavy and tough periods i wish i had used tampons in younger days too not as expected. still good. it was the only brand available when i started using tampons. now we have more option available. cry soft tampoons use very easily its good.but even if its meant for heavy flow it lasts unto 3 his only max on heavy flow days.no basically used it for swimming so it fulfilled my purpose. the cover around cotton results into less absorption and leakage. really absorbent and till now the best. life is so much easier now. comfort during periods is now so much better. i have been using this for a few months now. struggled initially to figure out the kinds of use. but glad i persisted. i would recommend it to ever girl and women worldwide i was a bit scared that it would not be comfortable but when i started using it i am really used to it so good k tampons r really very easy n comfortable to use. i haven t used any sanitary napkin since i m using tampons. they r better then sanitary napkins n also reduces one day of or periods. best tampons available in the indian market depending on the flow they can last unto 6 7 hours also. super easy to use and worth the money. wonderful feeling. after so many years of dilemma i have tried them and now. i should have used them earlier. its safe and easy to use. very girl and women should use it. this is something i always wanted to try . first time i tried campan and its amazingly good and comfortable product . i loved it . i have purchased the same heavy flow campan from amazon before as well and was very happy with it. but this time i am disappointed. it does not even last for 2 hours. i have faced embarrassment because of this. very low quality. good i ve been using these since eyes no leakage u don t even feel u r on periods give it a try u ll never look back its a life save.no sanitary pads can beat it.tampons are grm specially o.b procomfort. it s the first time i m using tampoons i she say these are just far.takes a few times to get tuned into but once you get the hang of it it s like wearing nothing at all.try this girls you won t be disappointed of you hate the pad thing then you girls are lucky to buy this product. its like you are far away form the periods easy to insert and remove. for the first

napkin. some sanitary napkins tend to cause rashes and stick to you and they prove to be pretty uncomfortable at night. i pretty much try to sleep in every position possible till i find the right one to settle into but pads restrict movement. however tampons can cause infections when they are used for longer than meant for tax 4 hours . which means you re donna have to make constant trips to the restroom which can be a bit annoying but once you get used you donna love it. i am glad that they are biodegradable hence co friendly which is great:ok hand light skin tone: it doesn t work if you get county/ clot period it will leak if you have that otherwise its really good the absorption is also good and the best thing is that it is made out of organic cotton so no chemicals. it feels very comfortable its like nothing is inside. round them to be much softer than all the others i have used so far in india. i am not sure if these are terrified as these are a very new entry in the market. but they were not at all harsh on the skin and the absorbing capability also seems decent. the only drawback is they don t have a twist and open wrapped. instead you have to remove the thin strip off which is sometimes hard to do. i always hesitated using tampons due to hygienic issues but when i saw such reputed brand selling tampons i thought to give it a try and to my surprise i really loved it. it is so easy to use and it makes me feel like my period problems have all vanished. it is very comfortable to use and the design is such that your won’t even feel the presence. there are no foul smells. the absorption is so high as compared to regular pads we generally use. the price also is very reasonable if we talk of the comfort it provides. totally recommended. to i was initially using the of pro comfort for years and used strong once. met me tell these are amazing way better that of they have better absorbent and it doesn t leak that often. will be definitely using these from now onwards. see safe tampons are the best and organic. have been using them for years and always happy good product heavy absorption comfortable . i would say it to be a genuinely good product. good absorbent. however it depends upon the flow. first time users may have a little trouble because it doesn t come with applications. without experience there may be itching or rashes on skin. but in overall it is definitely a good product. the campan has great absorbent and it can be used on and rd day. p.s. dont forget to remove it after 6 hours. it is super comfortable. you may completely forget about them. i highly recommend it. it is easy to put and remove. it actually leaned on my rd day when there will be no chance of leaking. totally shocked.and product absorbent is literally so bad. it always soaked on one side and always half soaked.disappointed c it was my first experience with tampons. looks like someone already opened this box. but inside the box all tampons are in good

bought menstrual cup but couldn t insert as i was unable to manage the folds red to insert it read rivers that tampons were easier to insert than cups and decided to try it but at st time it didn t go and i ended up wasting it but i was determined to use it so tried it again the same day by being calm and it went well . why didn t i try it earlier man.strands:not tampons by johnson and johnson are easily available in most medical stores in india so they were my st but of does have leakage issues and with fewer size option they are def not meant for heavy flow days. well are in 4 sizes and the super are great for heavy days while i use 2 sizes super for st 2 and half days and mind for last days as super hurts co of less publication.steps for using campan:no. now your body first. cry inserting a finger on normal days on period days its already enough lubricated so it won t hurt while inserting.no.now the best position you are comfortable with to insert and remove it smoothly. stay calm. it will hurt while removing at first time but 2 cycle into it and it will come out haste free. of its not coming out take a deep breath and relax and try again it will come outno. now how your flow varies during the cycle and use the sizes according to it and the publication you feel at the moment.no. deep check on your body and also put time if you forget things. see i used tampons for the first time and these things have sizes. when people say tampons don t hurt they do while taking it out if you buy the wrong size like in my case i bought a size too big. i mean as its too big for me it gets very uncomfortable while sitting. but in general as a campan it has very good absorbancy and it doesn t let your period leak so i d recommend it but please take care of the size thing : good product product is good price very good for double 16 16 good product but less absorbent i used to use of tampons but for some reason they have become harder to find. these bell ones are equally good. the only issue is that the twist action to remove the outer plastic packing is not as smooth as the of one. part from this small issue they are very comfortable and great for heavy flow. comfortable and easy to use. i ll suggest to buy according to the flow. is you might find it uncomfortable in light flow days. he will not be having a period feelinggreat product it works greatperiods are really painful but this gives us less tension of our periods easy to use and insert. is it is super absorbent it expands in size after absorbing and feels quite dry and discomforting while removing. by suggestion is not to use while sleeping though many sites suggest it can be used for unto 8 hours avoid use for long hours to avoid toxic shock syndrome tss and extreme dryness. but definitely useful during days of very heavy bleeding. the tampons turned out to be nothing different .i am a heavy bleeder first 2 days and i really need a campan which can be used for least 3 4 his on my heavy days .i used bell and it goes on only for 2 his on my heavy day.so changing every the is a big task for me.i had used strong campan earlier to this and its capacity is his too. i wanted a change and after looking at the reviews i bought bell.but to my dismay it turned out to be just like any other brand.now i am stuck with 32 pieces of this campan and i dot know what to do with it.absorbent is really low in tampons. the product overall was amazing. does what it was supposed to do. also it is super comfortable if you use it in the right way. for the people trying it for the first time or are new at using tampons these are good and also at a good price. mind better option for heavy flow his is perfect. i felt easy to use. and one single super plus campan piece would work for unto 4 to 5 hours. the product is good or over night i have tried other product but this seems to a cut above the rest.i am sure you would appreciate my suggestions. it’s good for those heavy days and the days you go for a swim it stay were it should be and feels comfortable took. it’s a must buy if you into activities or if you have heavy flow this product is very nice absolutely good and easy to use must buy very good for heavy flow days. tampons are far better than sanitary napkins. wolves the purpose. you can swim.dance.play.without worry. its thicker than the of ones. but good still. takes some getting used to. uncomfortable some times. but good for heavy flow. only for very heavy periodsnfelt of is beat for comfort but absorbing wise this is good product is nice. i am already using it since long

With 100% protection from staining, the tampons provide protection for upto 4-6 hours.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/615pfXCmSzL._SY355_.jpg,west product i tried this company for the first time but the size was smaller than the one i usually use in terms of length which is a major factor in absorbing the flow unfordable price. periods made a little bit easy. must try. it made rashes in vagina. it s plastic covering is hard to remove . i can t use it because of pain of rash even though it absorb lots of blood good quality product last delivery which i like the most. i got delivered on within 2 days which was very helpful. his is a non application product but if you are super nervous u can definitely go with the one that comes with an application. i use tampons since about 15 years and i ve never experienced anything this bad. i ve had cheap bands in europe that would not last as long as of but at least they d go in without struggle. since i live in india y years i ve been using of even tried that japanese brand i don t remember it s name but they had applications so they worked though they had poor absorbent.not goes in like a charm and stays there it can last up to 8 hours with average flow. in 4 hours can see multiple times before i need to change the campan.nnut this iron thing it s even smaller than of but it hurts when i try to push it in after washing up. it hurts so bad and i ve had to throw a couple of them as they just bent instead of going where they were supposed to. and after an hour it s soaked and needs to be changed leaking almost. while with same flow and even stronger flow of lasts 4 6 hours. line less absorbent i could live with that . but the pain it gives while inserting that is inhuman.nno bought this only until my of pack arrives as was in urgency. will never make this mistake again. they re not even cheaper. i mean if you give cheap quality at least charge less no nbottom line: absolutely not recommended. verdict of experienced

bought menstrual cup but couldn t insert as i was unable to manage the folds red to insert it read rivers that tampons were easier to insert than cups and decided to try it but at st time it didn t go and i ended up wasting it but i was determined to use it so tried it again the same day by being calm and it went well . why didn t i try it earlier man.strands:not tampons by johnson and johnson are easily available in most medical stores in india so they were my st but of does have leakage issues and with fewer size option they are def not meant for heavy flow days. well are in 4 sizes and the super are great for heavy days while i use 2 sizes super for st 2 and half days and mind for last days as super hurts co of less publication.steps for using campan:no. now your body first. cry inserting a finger on normal days on period days its already enough lubricated so it won t hurt while inserting.no.now the best position you are comfortable with to insert and remove it smoothly. stay calm. it will hurt while removing at first time but 2 cycle into it and it will come out haste free. of its not coming out take a deep breath and relax and try again it will come outno. now how your flow varies during the cycle and use the sizes according to it and the publication you feel at the moment.no. deep check on your body and also put time if you forget things. see i used tampons for the first time and these things have sizes. when people say tampons don t hurt they do while taking it out if you buy the wrong size like in my case i bought a size too big. i mean as its too big for me it gets very uncomfortable while sitting. but in general as a campan it has very good absorbancy and it doesn t let your period leak so i d recommend it but please take care of the size thing : good product product is good price very good for double 16 16 good product but less absorbent i used to use of tampons but for some reason they have become harder to find. these bell ones are equally good. the only issue is that the twist action to remove the outer plastic packing is not as smooth as the of one. part from this small issue they are very comfortable and great for heavy flow. comfortable and easy to use. i ll suggest to buy according to the flow. is you might find it uncomfortable in light flow days. he will not be having a period feelinggreat product it works greatperiods are really painful but this gives us less tension of our periods easy to use and insert. is it is super absorbent it expands in size after absorbing and feels quite dry and discomforting while removing. by suggestion is not to use while sleeping though many sites suggest it can be used for unto 8 hours avoid use for long hours to avoid toxic shock syndrome tss and extreme dryness. but definitely useful during days of very heavy bleeding. the tampons turned out to be nothing different .i am a heavy bleeder first 2 days and i really need a campan which can be used for least 3 4 his on my heavy days .i used bell and it goes on only for 2 his on my heavy day.so changing every the is a big task for me.i had used strong campan earlier to this and its capacity is his too. i wanted a change and after looking at the reviews i bought bell.but to my dismay it turned out to be just like any other brand.now i am stuck with 32 pieces of this campan and i dot know what to do with it.absorbent is really

pack first as a trial and immediately bought three regular packs afterwards . great quality. soft cotton. very good i better prefer this tampons than pads. really comfortable and easy to wear . to buy it not easy. take a due from johnson tampons and put a covering on the campan which makes it easier to use. with ease of use comfort would also be better. probably the only drawback. absorbency is very poor last for hardly one hour only these are my first tampons. i have been using them from 6 months. and they are really amazing. must come out of some weird myth and start using tampons because you wont realize that you are on your periods. specially the flow tampons. they are really perfect:red heart: i tried tampons for the very first time and now i feel pads are a nuisance against these tiny come rolls. great buy too much comfort i ordered oh tampons a few months ago after doing a lot of research. most of the reviews i read on amazon were positive and encouraging while some were inclining towards a to to . were s my personal and honest experience.nfirst of all when you order this product it comes in a pack of 3 with 10 tampons in each packet. you can see from the pictures i have posted that each campan is carefully wrapped in plastic with the help of a thin yellow strip. there is also an instruction leaflet inside that clearly guides you on how to use the product and answers some relevant questions related to it.nnow coming to my first trial of the product and how it went. when you are a first time it is advisable to buy the slimmest campan you can find and preferably use it on the days when your flow is not heavy. to i used it on my rd day of menstruation i normally use pads . it took me a while to get comfortable with the idea that i am about to insert something down there. to figure out where to insert and how to position the campan so that i could push it in was a huge task to say the least. further in the first few tries i felt a burning sensation when i tried to push it. to i applied some coronet oil all over it and around the tip specially . it took me a good 10 15 mind and a lot of sweating to get the thing inside. i was very scared that the string will break when i pull it out and so i didn t push it enough inside me. may be that caused some discomfort. by the the time it was all over i was dripping with sweat. i kept it on for nearly 3 hours. i couldn t sit. i couldn t walk properly. i just needed or bent. i faced problems while passing urine and couldn t poor oh nodded . finally i couldn t bear with it and removed it. his part was very smooth it came out with a little tug. but the campan hadn t absorbed fully. i disposed it in a sustain after properly wrapping it in a toilet paper as well as a newspaper to ward off the smell. thereafter i continued to used pads for the remaining days. i remember not being able to breathe normally the entire time i wore tampons. may be because i was too tense nafter a month i used a campan again but this time on my first day that s very brave of me i know i was familiar with the process and so was able to quickly get the product inside without much difficulty and pushed it in further than before. however i could still feel it inside me. normally this shouldn t happen. you would absolutely feel nothing. i don t know what went wrong this time but i felt uncomfortable as usual and removed the campan only after an hour or two of wearing it. the experience was not different from the previous one.nthe only plus point of wearing a campan in the right way only is that you don t need to worry about any sort of leakage or rashes. it stays firmly inside as the walls of the vagina hold it tightly. i didn t wear a pad when i wore a campan. there s no bad odour of period blood and you absolutely need not worry about a stain at all. it s good in that way.nno may need to figure out how to use a campan in the best way possible after a few more tries. it s a great product. it just requires practice and of course a lot of patience to try out stuff like this. the key is to stay calm and keep trying till you get it right. his product is truly revolutionary and can possibly make your life easier and carefree during painful periods. normal h. of absorption is not good not so

dayspair it with a party line to be tension freeyou will not regret buying it never going back to pads again in my life. his thing literally made my life so easy whenever i am wearing it i even remember that i am on my period except the changing times anyway for beginners like me when in your first time inserting a campan please do it in the bathroom cause it can be a lot mess. while removing the campan you can feel little uncomfortable if after inserting a campan it is hurting you remove it immediately it is not supposed to hurt you it just means that you have not inserted it further enough. for beginners i would advise you to first gather information about tampons from internet and then try this. great absorbent very come.no recommend using sizes according to your flow and comfort. i ve been using this brand and type for many years. happy with it as usual. for a sanitary product the box was sealed and crumpled. however the tampons seemed intact. absolutely love these tampons. feel bad about the plastic wastage but cups don t suit me. these are perfect thank you tamxpax and amazon why on earth i was using pads for so many years this is the beset thing that has happened to me no got really irritated by only thinking of the periods because of the sanitary pads. whichever brand i used . no comfort at all . that too so many years. though these are only 5 days of the month but why should we compromise on our comfort by using pads .coming to the point . i ordered few tampons before for heavy flow . but those bands didn have any application with it and was hard to use as i was new to it . so if you are a st time you should pick a campan with an application . also for the st time choose smaller size just to check. tampons without application must be good but try and get those when you are use to it. big sized tampons will give you discomfort l. also if the position of the campan is also wrong that too will give you discomfort . so choose accordingly.happy women s day girl bosses needed a super plus for heavy flow. but couldn t find. to had to buy this. and its good . great product. he always been ordering it from amazon. superfast 1 day delivery.very comfortable to use esp bc of application. west product esp when trying out tampons for the first time. the box of tampons was not sealed close when i opened the package. to rashes to

surprised because cloud tail is usually reliable the seal was torn open. i cannot for the love of all comprehend why the seal was open and easily sold to customers that is the reason for it why a

international reviews. almost all indian customers are getting it with seal open. that a sham. very nice product easy to use worst product. least value for money. the size of the regular flow tampons

softness west pads in market.soft thin. comfortable i m using this nine pads from almost 6/7 months. but this time i ve received torn package. please don t do this again definitely a good product for given price. such better softer comfortable than stayfree whisper ultra etc.ni have been using same pads for about 8 months and they are absolutely worth buying and using as compared to any other brand within same price range. not worth. very very convenient n comfortable received pack not 3 n pack was torn n opened inside product quality go for it his is good sanitary napkin. large size and good absorbent. works well for all nights and long hours. it s thin soft and rash free. certainly worth a try. good quality comfort good product at this price comfortable and super absorbent for busy women and comes with disposal pouch so easy to discard. their products are good very comfortable but don t why if i ordered different pack size there product quality quite different everytime this pack not so much satisfying using. must go for it. his is one of the product which gives 320mm size and with less chemical scent. using this since 1 year. and am fan of this good for long time it matches the usefulness of any major brand like whisper or stay free but far more cheaper than these. i would highly recommend this one. size is good and very absorbent. quality very poor west product. rest money loss i received only one package of sanitary pads amazing it s soft n comfortable according to price i have never used such great sanitary napkins . this one stands out on expectations. it s come soft surface avoids rashes on skin and wider back protect from leakage. used already 2 pack and going to buy more in future. don t think much ladies you will definitely donna like சூப்of் absorbing power is zero had quality :enraged face: the pads are so soft really soft and thin. they were also larger than i expected and it was a pleasant surprise. that is mildly concerning. is that it is xi biodegradable and it is presented as a really good thing. from my surface research it is not as it creates microplastics. i advise you to do your own research before taking my word for it though because it was only a nursery look. otherwise the pads are soft long thin and cost low. by honest review no rashes no pain or hardness but yes it gives only 6 pads for 75 is which is a bit costly but i purchased in bulk of 6 packs in 300rs so it s great deal andros it s super absorbent and comfortable with large size so no issue of leaking i liked it and it s best from other popular bands.thank god i found something daring for my body. these pads are worth buying. they absorb really well and keep me comfortable while not staining clothes as well. i definitely recommend this product. is per my expectations fragrance comfort and usage everything is just perfect. you will feel wet continuously in this pad. of you normal period flow go ahead in this price. the pouches available are very best initiative. i am using this specific type from few years now and no complaints. knnot lads are lightly scented and long enough. but the wings are small hence after couple hours of heavy flow the pad starts overflowing resulting in stains. these pads cannot hold heavy flow during night time too the pad starts leaking after putting pressure on it. like if you sit down after a sleep of 7 his you will see stains on your clothes. overall. not solving the purpose hence not recommended. very soft such a nice nine sanitary pads . they are so comfortable and are best for moderate flows. they smell nice. a pack contains 6 pads with a disposal pouches. easy to carry. they are long enough so girls dont worry about the nights. but the blue is not good. it doesn t stick properly so think and buy. good very good product m using it second timethank you amazon for fattest delivery i like to use this product. it s absorbent is very good and doesn t feel like i m wearing something it s that much comfortable. whoever using whisper. all don t buy this one. whisper is far better than this. line pads are just like a cotton cloth and not absorbing well and making us uncomfortable. haste of money.no use. i am use this product last 5 years some issues. is i am using this. the pad is thin long but the problem is the pad oaks the blood only the area getting wet it didn transfer the whole. packing was good but product cover was tired i really like this product very comfortable smooth i really loved good product. one of the best sanitary pads i ever used it provides trash bags that s what i like about it.equality is also good. hygienic i liked this pad . before i used other brand pad but after using this i feel too comfortable. its too soft and dont feel irritating. because if cotton top layer it feel like feather. in top of that which i liked most is it has disposal bag its easy to carry and also easy to keep it the purse. of any one haven t tried it go for once:two hearts: softness absorbancy is less as compared to whisper to for it . its unfordable and good good i feel very very comfortable wearing it. soft and come. to rashes problem anymore. perfect size good quality and super comfortabledoesn t cause rashes or discomfort not useful in heavy flow. not bad amazing productno really liked it so much pads are very soft as comfortable.must say worth money . satisfying product. it s the best product.more comfortable to carry and also for heavy flow.i purchased it many times from amazon. amazing sanitary pads.than to amazon :smiling face with halo: i was using whisper ultra for last years and thought to change the brand so i bought nine and it worked like magic. so soft super comfortable leakage proof.in love with it. the product is really nice nd very comfortable for our period usenut in my pack i m missing the disposal napkinsplease make sure once while or sending the

free these are good quality in the thin of pads category. price wise also okay. to compare the price and number of pads from other companies before ordering must buy it very useful good for periods good one is name suggests soft and absorbent with scent product came in brown paper packing which was torn. should have used good material for it. i like it good product seems to be face bad qualityoriginal whisper quality is not there his product is very badnbilkul bear pad h . 3 hour me change anna pad ha h vice product good gros:does not give me rashesnone:want use for more than 4 days in continuation not limited to this product nwere is what i have figured out. now comfortable you would be with a kind of sanitary napkin depends on your cycle length flow and most importantly gap between thighs to prevent chafing . i belong to medium flow 3 day flow 3 days sporting/ light bleeding category with no gap between thighs and can easily use this pad for 4 days both in day and night. the trick lies in changing pad frequently to prevent rashes. the game changes for me personally was to start using party liners on light bleeding/ sporting days and this has helped prevent lot of discomfort specially in humid/ hot weather. any liners though a bit costly help immensely specially on no period day day of anticipated period light bleeding/ sporting. i like it s softness nd perfumed smell ultra thin pads quite comfortable. i have been using this product from past 7 8 years and i can’t switch ti any other brand or variety.not is soft in skin and this specially does not give rashes really very soft compared to other worst. his pack was out of stock in my city . finally i got it on amazon. thanks amazon and seller. totally bad item please don t buy this trusted brand and great saviour during the aunt rose days. extremely soft top layer. thought it s a cotton layer but mentioned as no cotton is used in making this product on the pack. thickness is around mmm so you even forget about it : nskeptical about the absorption and staining of the top soft layer during heavy flow days but wonderful it works fine with any flow provided a change is done for every 4 5 hours. his doesn t create rashes unlike some products. i usually get a pack of 30n or 50n so that it s economical per pad too. in short finally completely satisfied not a duplicate product the absorbable is very poor. a cheap product is sold in the name of whisper.ll take it back good product of you too have an issue of rashes.then this will be the best for you.this pad is so soft and smell is also very pleasant .loved it new version is excellent good it s very thin. i think it is one of the best thing i saw and it feels too comfortable and very less weight and also feels so dry and also airy fresh fell if you don t have any cramps then i think with this periods are like normal days co it is so much comfortable you should surely try this it is good at reasonable price softness is excellent but not for heavy bleeding days. vice lay videomust buy it .your money worth it .too much good and soft product .and no leakage issue whisper manufactures very good quality products. i would recommend buying this at amazon so that you may feel good in case of the price of the products at amazon cab first time me mine same product medical store se kharida to product i length and width on

cap par trust war k depend ho war lapse chigoe purchase kate had.thank you. good quality quality is very poor. had scent i have been regular customer of whisper since more than 20 years because of the quality it used to deliver . but since 2 years i am continuously experiencing bad quality of this product . also tried buying from proper shops to check if it’s issue with the online product . but all the same .heads are not at all absorbent i keep changing it every hour . quite horrible .no have no issues with my mensturation cycle got it confirmed with gynaecologist as well . not it on an offer price great an t go wrong with whisper. secure protection soft and quality pads always. very nice :ok hand: less money than make price not good i started using these ones few years back.now i can t use any other sanitary napkin as these not only absorb but also is so soft that the problem of rash is also minimal k but not for long wear. the inner package was opened. but pads are good. very soft and comfortable. suitable for long hours like office or outing. but length has been reduced. it was longer before.nut it is really good good product value for money his is very useful product. one should go to buy this. i have got this product at lower cost than the market price. except for the fact that it is on a slightly lower side of controlling the leakage it is a good product his is common with other completely cotton based napkins as well . i wouldn t recommend it for heavy flow days. but it solved my issue of rashes. thanks to the softness it provides. recommend started getting uncomfortable within 2 3 hours and it s long but the absorbing ability is also bit low. overall product is bit decent one of the best products for women hygienic. after years of using sanitary napkins of other bands for periods i find this particular product to be good for me. i usually get skin galleries like rashes and itching during menstruation due to the usage of sanitary pads. and spend sleepless nights or get disturbed sleep. but on using this product from whisper i felt very comfortable. to irritations rashes burning or other womanly issues. it definitely controls odour. quite comfortable even when going out on public transportation. it s definitely worth a try. i would appreciate if the manufacturer reduces the price of the product as many ladies can t afford to buy. soft cotton cover makes you feel comfortable and you can easily walk around in it and also do some exercises without getting rashes. however it feels wet all the time which is inconvenient size :thumbs up: good :thumbs up: not for long run.for heavy flow k to comfortable

this is life changing not is little bit at a higher price point so i use it on heavy days and use normal ones on normal days.no give it a try :beaming face with smiling eyes: these pads are so soft and comfortable and best quality. best thing about these pads is the fact they live up to what they claim. i wear them without worrying about anything no leakage no toxic material nothing just sheer comfort. i like this product .very comfortable a best friend for every girl. the best gift anyone can buy for a female friend. a mother can trust azah for her princess. purchased for my daughter and found it useful. excellent. vice product very good product rash free packing was congested over all good disposal bags are designed better than last time. good organic unfordable product than many in the market. very soft and comfortable non allergic pads.ladies who are facing irritation from using plastic coated pads should try this. to i’m a big fan of ah products but the recent regular size ones are sometimes hard to pull off. they leave sticky cotton patches on the sides that’s hard to pull out. it’s just this one time though with the of ones i don t have any trouble pulling them off always used whisper thought my life and finally found something way better than those pads.pain thing it does not cut yourskin and cause any sort of irritation to your skin it is that soft.i am glad my friend recommended this to me. it s absolutely movable product. compared to other bands it s very long and no scent smell and cotton . it s eye opened product. girls have to least try once . must buy instead of party liners for those last days of periods angle free soft hair. less hair fall with this product reviewing this after usage of 4 months. good organic and must buy product. right weight and thin. to rashes to leakage u won t feel u r using a pad. to sound while walking. it comes with disposal cover which is more convenient for office goes and traveller s. the only drawback is it collects the flow only in the middle doesn t spread anywhere. it is advisable to change or napkin every 5 to 6 his. i liked it very much. good packing and very beautiful pads. oh my oh my oh my no have used whisper almost all varieties for years owing to the lack of choice at that time . when i switched to well. i have tried number of other varieties available at that time like carefree stay free and then i tried this one…mostly because i wanted to switch to using organic products. his one is super super comfortable sticks perfectly on the party absorb heaviest flow with ease without any leads feels super dry even when full and the best part is it’s disposal system. it is very convenient and discreet to carry in sandbag or even in jeans. i don’t get any rashes or inches which i often used to get with whisper.nnreferring to the pick i unloaded the package has undergone good amount of traveling with me and hence in bad shape. but i hope it helps to make your decision. i have purposely opened the pad to show it’s disposal system. …. and yes it’s very long so no need to buy separate nighttime pads nthis of not a paid review must wanted to inform very come good absorbent.just love it his product now i am using for last 1.5 years such a good and hygienic product and quality is so good comfortable pads but from last few months they are making some changes with size of pads and disposal bags are difficult to close as sticking is not proper in disposal bags.otherwise aah sanitary napkins are so good so go for it girl s :smiling face with smiling eyes: it s worth buying it even though it s a had bit expensive especially if you have sensitive skin. it s comfortable and every pad has its own biodegradable bags that you can dispose off. amazon is selling its old stock at the same price. his comes without the seal in the disposal bags. in top of that this time the box containing all pads that i received was without a seal which is completely unacceptable.no request amazon to kindly stop selling the old stock specially for a product like a sanitary pad as one can develop infections because of this. also if you anyway doing that please sell it at a lower price and not at the mrp.nos far as the product is concerned i have been its loyal customer for a very long time. it is really comfortable to use and very gentle. i used to experience rashes because of sanitary pads previously but with ah rashes are no more a concern. however i wouldn’t suggest this product to someone with heavy bleeding since it is 100 and the absorption is not as great as other bands in the market. after twitching to these pads i haven t faced rashes which was a common incident after having periods.they come in their own cover is also a plus which makes disposing pads easier. product is good but product packing was the worst to wonder people are looking trust on amazon the pads are extremely comfortable i don t even realise that in wearing one because of the high quality and soft feel of the cotton. am so glad i took a chance on ah they have changed my life for the better. am recommending all my family members and friends to switch to ah right now. of you’re reading this please switch to wearing a pure cotton pad. thank me later :waving hand: using this product for last two to three years very much satisfied with it been using these for a while now. soft rash free and very comfortable even on heavy flow days. haven t experienced any leakage. the disposable bags are another plus. these sanitary pads are comfortable to use and the quality is good .the best napkins i m using so far. but the size of 30 ll has been reduced. less broad this time and the disposal bags are also not that good . overall a great product. his product now i am using for last 2 years i loved it the absorption comfort is awesome. there is no fragrance and it s awesome but from last few months they are making some changes which has caused a bit of problemno. size of pads andno.disposal bag are difficult to close as sticking is not proper in disposal bag.notherwise pads are good. to for it. lads are amazing they stick to party very well you really need to pull hard to remove. absorption capacity is largest among what i have used till date.uncomfortable soft nonirritating very large in size. great product i have been using it for years now. feels premium and and is of very good quality totally worth spending the money because you can be assured of not leaking. the pad doesn t have proper adhesive which makes it slightly uncomfortable. have been using this product since last two years and this is the first time i am facing this problem. his is really comfortable and very light and they have a range of sizes like other bands to suit your needs. to fragrance and no itching or rashes. am writing this review after three months of usage first of all am very such impressed with their packing second the quality the pad is so thin with leathery soft material you dont feel like you are wearing something heavy for long time completely biodegradable to rashes no itching and most importantly to chemicals am really more than a happy girl today after using this sanitary napkins there i used to suffer from my childhood using the fig bands like whisper stay free after falling for there beautiful commercial it took me more than 20 years to realise now i became a prey to their commercial and how i have become one reason spoiling the mother earth and also my health i promise girls once you start using these there is no during back to any cheap chemical napkins. these were one of the contest most comfortable pads i ve tried. they re a little prices but if you paid them up with a cheaper brand for the last few days and keep them for heavy flow they ll justify that price.nthese were so soft. didn t have any rashes or irritation after such a long time. plus the packing is pretty cut and made me feel like special and it s my favorite color so i stay winning the . truly organic no toxic smells no unnecessary texture.nney only grip is that the blue was too strong. i had trouble pulling it off my underwear for one or two pads but the rest of the experience was good enough that solo. the overall quality of the pad as well as the packing material used has fallen. the paper disposal bag is now of poor quality tears while opening and the blue strip doesn t hold it in place. the plastic covering of the pad is also poor. the pad quality has declined over the last year and it tears while removing it. there are only 4 of pads and the rest are regular size pads whereas in the description it is mentioned as all of pads.really disappointing. i am 2 weeks postpartum and have been using pads daily. when i was discharged and could transition to regular pads i first started out with whisper brand napkins. however i soon found out that those napkins are very drying due to their synthesis material and they caused a lot of discomfort especially as i had to wear them over a period of weeks. hence i was looking for pads that were made from a softer material which wasn’t so harsh on my skin. ah napkins are very soft and absorbent. even though i wear them the entire day the area doesn’t feel dry and uncomfortable. i would recommend this product to anyone who feels like existing pads in the market are too rough/uncomfortable/causing dryness. made in prc west pads till date. not a sign of rash or discomfort or even bad odour his has been my go to product for awhile now. i started having major skin issues a few months back with the popular bands of pads and was looking for a different one. and i found this to be perfect for me.not is all cotton has no added scent and for my light to medium flow is perfect for me. the packing is also pretty good. the cover is made of paper and disposal is haste free.the only thing i have a problem with is the blue on the wings. it is not sticky enough and therefore doesn t stay stable. otherwise it s a good product.thank god it s available on amazon. i always get next day delivery if my periods come announced. it works well as it gives no rashes. it comes in beautiful packing with outer pouches to discard napkins gracefully. i am not buying it for now just because i found it expensive than other naturally made napkins. amazing product i have used many sanitary pads. but 99 of them gave me rashes. but this one org unbelievable super soft and super comfortable. the concept of disposal bags is more than awesome. i m donna order this for my every periods. thank you so much for inventing such an awesome organic product. the founders of this company have did much researches and also consulted with gynecologists. that is why they have came up with this fabulous invention. before commenting on the plastic used in this product please read in google about it. you will get an idea how awesome these napkins are. ah sanitary pads are a must try for any woman / girl. these are really soft on your skin and doesn t give you any rashes. highly absorbent it keeps you going for hours without any stress of staining. side wings are firmly liable and more comfortable to use. the best part is the packing. each pad is packed separately in a nice cover making it very easy to carry anywhere with you. also you do not have to look for a tissue / packet to dispose of the used pads. the cover serves this purpose too. i am highly impressed with the quality offered at this price. strongly recommended to try extremely soft and comfortable. safe for me and the planet. his is really a very nice product :smiling face with smiling eyes::smiling face with smiling eyes: i was fed up of the sticky smell of usual ultra pads and was looking for cups or cotton pads. these pads are a nice change and i think i would continue on them till i find something better. lads are very soft on skin have good absorbancy and dont smell in case we forget to change in low flow days. the disposal packing is so good that i think it can attract others to think what is hidden inside :p the ll size is quite long so check the length before ordering.ncoming to sons these are double the cost of ultra pads and may be triple of normal pads. also except upper layer it doesn t look organic or cotton. good quality high absorption thin and super comfortable. please note this is the second time i have ordered and all though sanitary napkins are great this time none of the disposal bags have the sealed stick. it is very inconvenient to dispose in the bag without sealing stick. first time i ordered the disposal bags were perfect. disappointed after paying the amount you have under delivered used many sanitary pads and been twitching since it gives me rashes. his pad is soft and great to use. even the normal flow pad is long and good enough to go during heavy flow. and easy to dispose. i have been a regular customer to purchase aah napkins and i just admit that it was the best…but now there has been some changes…absorbent has reduced and the paper material of the disposal bags have changed. the most difficult thing was that the pad just sticks like anything to the cloth and when you try to take it off it refuses to come apart this tearing into bits and pieces. i was a huge fan of the previous version and also recommended it to many of my family and friends but now totally disappointed and looking for other bands. good product west pads to ever use . it has very cut packing and just everything about the pad is nice. it is soft comfortable rash free and most importantly co friendly what else do we need. you should surely go for it using these pads actually feels quite luxurious thanks to the disposal bags that are provided and the overall packing of the product. it makes you feel good about using it.nnabsorbancy wise its as good as any whisper or other drugstore brand. i m hopeful that the organic cotton means better health in the long term as i ve read that the chemicals used in the standard drug store bands can be harmful .not would be lovely if ah could come up with a fully biodegradable pad along the lines of what peesafe has as it would be so much better for the environment. i recently came across ah organic sanitary pads and i am very happy after using them. they are very soft and comfortable. the absorbent of these pads is very good. it will not feel feel your wet for 6 to 8 hours. they will not leave any skin galleries or rashes because they are very thin and soft. they are well sized too. the best part is they come with one extra complimentary pad with very good packing. i love these organic pads ad would recommend to all women to try once. is they are organic you would not feel guilt while disposing them product was way better before now it’s not that great. i would love to talk to someone from the company so that i can share my words with them. i liked it. thanks. review after using it for two daysnnoah organic sanitary pads are definitely worth the penny. they are soft comfortable and has an amazing absorbing capacity unlike other pads available in the market. it first i thought maybe they re too slim to hold on to heavy flows but i was really amazed to see how good these pads are. the of size is huge and so are the regular pads to glad i often for ah. recommended to all. i was bit apprehensive before ordering them at first because my experience wasn t great in past with other brand who is selling equally expensive yet customized pads.nwhen i received my box of ah pads the packing and care note inside the box was truly amazing and the gesture of sending one complimentary pad was also beautiful too.nthe pads are very soft tender on your skin and doesn t leave you with any skin galleries or rashes also they are thin on your skin. they are well sized and comfortable to wear and absorb heavy flow without any problemnno am happy ah girl and would recommend it to every women. these are worth buying and so stylish to carry in your pockets or bags.nnay to go ah west initiative product is open.and wrong sizes receivedvery unhappy i have been wanting to make the switch to big degradable pads for a while now and this was the first brand i tried and i must say i am converted. the outer packing is stunning and each pad comes individually packed in a plastic free cover which can then be used for disposal of a used pad which is genius . the pad itself has a good length tried the ll size and is very absorbent. it is very thin and does not cause any discomfort. though slightly prices than regular pads i feel it is well worth the investment i would like to tell both positive and negative things about ha.first of all do negative thing it does not absorb too much flow. you have to change the pad a little sooner. but this is not a big deal. because no matter which organic pad you use it will be a problem.now come to the positive things about ha. first of all ha is made from organic cotton. it has not used any synthesis finer at all which reduces the rashes and itching problems that occur every month. it is very soft which gives very good feeling. disposal packs have come with it which reduces the tension of running for news paper again and again. i love using organic pads so 5 stars for ha from me. using this for almost 2 years. but this is the first time i am not comfortable with size adhesive quality and disposal bag quality. everything is diminished. need to look for an alternate. very easy to use and dispose as well. good quality more than the pain and the weakness that you suffer during senses is the fear of sporting and the whole rigmarole of disposing hiding the napkins.nnot can easily carry it in your hand purse sling bag without drawing attention to it. of you do draw attention it s in a good way our to its pleasant colours and sleepless. also you don t have to gather newspapers and poly bags to dispose off post usage. you can easily seal it squarely in the same bag that the individuals napkins come in. i even loved the special packing it is delivered in. feels like wrapping a gift. and oh absorbent is far better than whisper ultra nights too which has recently caused me some embarrassing moments. good work guns you take off some of the pinch of those days. deep going i couldn’t be more happy and satisfied : the issue with the regular pads i had was the fact that none of the pads helped me with heavy flow and i used to change easily 4 5 pads a day. additionally i used to get rashes and it used to pitch.with these i haven’t faced any issue. i change 3 pads on a daily basis extremely soft and most importantly economy friendly.another quality about these pads is that the material used makes it feel very plush. love the packing that it comes with along with a cover with stick to wrap and throw your used pads.thank you guns : it used to be better before.sticking side is so much sticky that when you try to roll it off the party it gets torn.may be a bit of improvement needed to make material bit sturdy. recently i have used ah organic sanitary pad.and found this napkin period friendly and comfortable.the best part is that this organic sanitary pads are free of synthesis fibres chemicals and other harmful breach and toxins.during my heavy flow of periods i feel dry and comfortable using it.its really a skin friendly product which is made with finest organic cotton.its a leak proof pad.you don t have to worry on or heavy days also and giving rash and irritated free experience.i would like to recommend to all the girls out there.and yes it comes in a biodegradable disposal bags which u can carry any where.to try it once the innovative organic pads offered by ah worth mentioning. the pads are soft have good absorbent quality and sticks well during usage. it offers protection for 5 8 hours without any sort of irritation or rashes.nnot s free from harmful chemicals so it s skin friendly and also helps in checking odour.nnon the lip side product is prices. it should be dismounted or offered in combs. moreover lack of proper advertising makes it somewhat invisible in customer s view. proper advertising and suitable discount will definitely uplifts the sales i i am writing this review after 6 months use of this product i never feel comfortable with any bands so usually i always changing bands time to time i came across about this product while searching for rash free organic pads. his is the best product i personally recommend this product for the people with heavy flow and have to stand for long time in your workplace. :thumbs up: am satisfied with this product good i liked the product it s soft and comfortable . have been using product of a well known company but compared to that i felt this was more comfortable and irritation free. it absorb well and i found the disposal packet very handy for carrying the pad or to dispose after use. to for me it s overall nice experience and would suggest if you are looking for a soft comfortable organic napkin you can go ahead without second thought. i used to use stayfree and whisper sort of pads till now. it was always such a bad experience. yes the absorbent was good but at the cost of rashes sweat itching and the uncomfortable feeling of wearing a plastic. with lots of courage i tried pua and then ah. i liked this one better. never going back to the regular old bands ever again.no great great pad. to leakage. extremely comfortable. doesn fee like i’m wearing a pad. love it. wash free and very absorbent. i have switched to this. such a good and hygienic product which can be used to protect intimate area from infection during menstruation. felt comfortable during bedtime.tight sticky gums are to be appreciated . good product west one the product offers a great experience from beginning to end the box has colour code napkins according to the sizes the napkins themselves are super easy on the skin with nice absorbent no issues of leakage in 6 months of usage and the individual packing allows for a great disposing experience as well. really satisfied and happy with the purchase easy on the skin easy on the environment. in win situation comfortable and full of hygienic the box seal was broken from before ah sanitary napkins are too good .of daughter s use it since 4 to 5 years.the quality packing are awesome. by wife has been using stayfree for quite a long time then i decided to give it a try but these are the best sanitary pads she ever had very soft comfortable and with very good absorption. these are expensive than other bands but worth to spending some extra for the best quality and hygienic. very single pad comes in a small type of envelope which is good for to disposal. i highly recommend this item you can give it try and feel the difference. of u develop rashes during periods u co of pads u must buy this his is such a good product compare to other napkins high thumbs up fr aah sanitary :face blowing a kiss:the is made wid full of pure cotton so the is no irritation n very like weight n its absorbent last up too 3 to 4 his oats so cool.for myself most led one is disposal bags :smiling face with smiling eyes:thy only dislike but the product is the is no fragrance in the product so my suggestion is add some natural fragrance to it otherwise it is thy greatest one:smiling face with heart eyes:thnkuuu ah these are great. the packing and the ease of disposal makes them very convenient to carry along with you. i would have liked if they had an antibacterial strip like some of the other ones. they are comfortable and do not cause many rashes compared to the more popular ones in the market. though there are some which are better than these in that respect but not available so easily. i would buy them again. i have been using this since almost a year. were is my honest opinion:no. it is very soft and comfortable and being organic is the biggest plus.no. doesn t cause rashes.no. pocket friendly when compared to other organic napkins available in the market.no. change every few hours recommended for all sanitary napkins to avoid health issues and being hygienic and you would be good to go nonce tried you will never think of twitching to other napkins the ah company s sanitary pads quality are too low from the previous order. i m not satisfied with this order. to many previous order quality are too good but right now the pads quality too low. customers wants quality so please take action on this point if the company wants more orders. thank you. thank u so much for this product.i was planning to buy some other organic pad but due to the internet issue bymistakly i had selected this.i thought to try once how it donna be about my review a worth penny product.no comfortable even the busy schedule no rashes feeling thickness made so distracted before but this product made me so come at office and meetings.nabsorbency is perfect as i wanted.very ladies should try this. size shows 320mm as of but received regular size it s very convenient and comfortable product. it s very soft and easy to use.not s very large in size as compare to other sanitary pads. i like personally. i use many sanitary pads but all are not good to my skin but this is skin friendly and rashes free pads. it s has lots of absorbent power. i am very comfortable when i use it. it is very light in weight so don t tension to heaviness. i give big thumb jump to buy this

days. large size . full coverage from back least chances of leakage. west quality really good product the best part is comes with disposal bag product is good but the price was 325 delifree but delivery i was asked to pay 430 this is cheating hut chat h not as good as pink one i liked the product but they have not given biodegradable disposal bags inside as mentioned in the cover which has disappointed me as i purchased this product only boy along with pads they have promised free disposal bags nikita its very comfortable it s bad it s liking and most important is that it s getting reaction with it. vice lads are not for heavy flow and sometimes leads at the edges. average product good product is per price it s good but if you are looking for simple cotton pads it s not for you. it has one layer of something which i don t feel comfortable with. it s very comfortable and good absorbent and easily used as if i haven t wear something.i liked the biodegradable bags which comes with the pack which makes it easily disposal value for money not use.small size amazing his brand is good . trustworthy . :thumbs up: product is good but quality is changed. its good with good odor but quality is deteriorated than before an be used for short time .and not on heavy leakage days ordered line of cry comfort a few months back for my children no had started using it today noticed it was short was the size of a ‘regular pad’ i opened a new package measure it as shown in the image no pad of in size which was supposed to be of 275mm in length had our ed out to be of 258mm in length. i got the pink one from some shop random and ended up loving it.by sister was out of her pads so borrowed one and now we both just can t use any other.so i ordered online.this one is also not bad but i would suggest the pink one.and more fascinating part is that it comes with carry bags to dispose them.so u don t have to worry about finding bags. these are better :thumbs up: not good for initial 3 days of heavy flow. comfort is good these are ultra thin in the sense that they are not wide enough rarely gives all area coverage. the only time i d recommend using these is on those light flow days.these are not ultra thin as advertised and doesn t come in separate packing either. it d be difficult to carry it along.andros: value for money if it suits your needs. good product can be used for regular period days lads are very thin. absorb less raise s cheek had but par i sheet bald final at had. very nice product specially i like the disposal bag very comfortable but i don t like the scent :smiling face with smiling eyes: vice nd comfortable product nice i dont like this product . vice sanitary napkins and also disposal bag i have always used of and ordered this one as it was delivering next day and i really needed one. but it was a good choice that i had to make. the pads are super thin but yet very soft. the slight fragrance deluded from the pads is there even on using. quite absorbent and best thing the blue really keeps the pad in its place intact which is a problem with most of the other pads. so totally recommended it is actually very good . am going to change my choice only to line now to cover unfordable.no will recommend anyone to switch to menstrual cups but if you can t switch to it this pads are alternative option. really nice product. effective and long lasting good quality is good . but not for heavy flow . even on regular flow u need to change in every 3 4 hours waste of money the pad doesn t stuck to party cloth for more then min. the wings specially need to have string blue which help to stick the borders of party. hence not happy rest all good. very soft .no itching problem.nice product. value for

after 4 to 6 hours it s very nice average product. an not hold large flow. vice quality should be improved more not unto the mark .i just gave a try .but disappointed moved its super soft texture completely non allergic for me compared to the earlier products used.value pack .only problem is the frequency of pad changing due to less absorption. his is 199 rubles for 40 pads per coming 4.975

:thumbs up: i was looking for cotton pads. found line and are brand in sale as i didn t find my regular brand wonderize in stores looked for other option in amazon. line did not disappoint but i would still go for wonderize once stock is back. not this for 158 rubles in sale. good product at that price i will say.nnine of are i will say line for sure. it does the job well. to for it if you are looking for cotton pads. must ordered in regular size as well to try instead of stayfree regular.nnuts not thick compared to wondering that i would say. it thin compared to it but they do not come in individual pack. not easy to carry product in your purse. they are good for normal flow please don t use it for heavy flow it s a good sanitary napkin soft and comfortable but my big issue is that it comes without a wrapped to throw it with. the product is undoubtedly good but packing was not done by amazon. kindly work on the packing wonderful product good one and unfordable to use happy to purchase very comfortable. quality of this napkin is not any lesser than a big brand. not satisfied with this product my wife it is much much better than the popular known bands. its comfortable and

cried to test it.okay n good but not very good.it can be little more thick to jacket provide with pads. others r they provided with each pads per of. reasonable price like thin and absorbent product. it should be little longer in of category as compared to other bands. overall product is very absorbent thin and quality is very good. i like the biodegradable bags provided in packet. letter and bigger than stayfree cotton normal one comfortable n good quality. not for heavy flow can be used for lighter flow days. vice one good very soft and decently absorbent similar to the popular ones that we know and have been using . after using a renowned brand for almost a decade i thought of shifting to this and i dont regret a single bit of it. works for the last days of periods n not for heavy low. his is not fit for heavy flow it gets leaned easily n keeps u in unexpected situations. good absorption extremely comfortable very convenient to use. price also very reasonable. a must buy for all the ladies the pads are thin cotton not plastic and comfortable. absorb good and keep the surface dry. awesome i liked.it was very comfortable.and my small suggestion is pack like in oriental way.it is better to take any where. his product is not good it gave me rash and it s too wet it don t absorb much price is unfordable and quantity is so good accordingly very bad quality does not stick well and very thin please don t busy i m regretting it:loudly crying face::loudly crying face::loudly crying face::loudly crying face::loudly crying face::loudly crying face::loudly crying face: good vice goodno like quality not so good door quality of blue. to not stick well to the cloth and continue getting displaced. earlier too i used the product but it was good. his time the blue quality is not appropriate. line napkins is a economical soft and efficient one as of stayfree like bands. but one main disadvantage is it creates rashes in two days. to we can use this in between stayfree days rather than using this alone good but not for people with heavy flow good quality product in average product not fit for of size wrinkles during use skin friendly and easy to dispose i don t use pads as much as i did when i was younger but whenever i do i use this very brand. i don t want to buy again this leakage issue good product. absorption capacity is too much less. on t lasts for 2 hours. leaking continues vice product moved the product. very unfordable. will purchase it again vice good product and ex date also they given eyes product quality also good from the point of ordering

perfect for you. good product. its not broad like the other brand but good enough for someone with light to medium flow vice very comfortable and soft . package arrived in very good condition. line really is the way to go it has one of the contest pads ever. i recommend this for any pad users. these cotton pads are so soft. vice product product is good. but not advisable during heavy flow days. good product the pads don t leak and the menstrual fluid spreads well throughout the pad which keeps leakage away.non t forget to change pads from time to time as per your flow worst product don t buy those who have sensitive skin good vice product quality is not good to irritation and comfortable. i’m really liking this one. it’s better than stayfree secure. comfortable for white discharge

lay videono am really disappointed with the so called “oo biodegradable” plastic bag that you provide along. please do not mislead people by using such terms as biodegradable. because oo degradable plastic are only degradable not biodegradable or terrified comfortable after the big additions have broken down traditional plastic remain. even if the small pieces are microscopic the plastic still exists and can easily enter the environment. there are absolutely no benefits from using oo degradable plastic no really wanted to give a 5 star rating for the organic cotton pads until i got to know about the plastic bag. you could start replacing them with organic cotton bags which i’m damn sure would be attracting more people. i hope you take this as feedback and start taking action people like me would love to have your organic cotton pads. it s one of the best napkins in the market for women with sensitive skin and prone to infections. not leak proof. buying of pads is useless because it doesn t spread at all and stays in one place making it leak down and is spoiling dresses. i had used a full box before writing this review. the pads are skin friendly and disposal trappers are the only add on other than that highly disappointed. i won t buy it again. not a good product. please do not buy. the pads started to degenerate and were not unable although i bought them recently and the expire date is 2024 i.e 2 years before expire. that shows poor quality and bad shelf life. more comfortable perfect he ordered two boxes but we only got 1 boxand the payment is taken of two boxed his is by far my best purchase of all the sanitary napkins bought till date.didn t really expect that it works as shown on advertisements.his is my first time using ah and i m surely going to purchase this amazing experience.not really gave my mood an uplifts by keeping me rash free throughout the cycle.only gros no. regular size and of size comb is the best.no. most disposal wrapped is cool.no. feels like cloth colourless and clean.no. long wear won t feel wet even for 1 .no. lastly the blue is so firm it just doesn t get soiled and shrunk even after whole night use.non t think girls.if you love yourself pus go for this and treat yourselves during those weird days.thanks ah and amazon for this worst product. the first layer of the pad comes out after half an hour of using it. it does not hold its shape. the stick part is not at all good. it doesn solve any of its purpose. it doesn hold good even for 15 mind. the extra money that they charge i feel was used up on packing rather then the product itself. his is so far the best product i came across it didn t give me rashes at all and it doesn t have any fragrance. it s worth to buy this. his product is good didn’t get rashes at all loved packing everything is good . there is no blue on t buy.its bakers very comfortable no leakage problem pure cotton pads. too good. it’s very comfortable and strain free to chemicals to leads on i definitely :hundred points: recommend to use it co friendly products the product itself is good but d packing could’ve been better when i received it d box was all smashed up not meet expectation its is completely worth it i do really like the pads. they are very soft and thin and there is no way you will get a rash from these. i easily get rashes so for anyone with sensitive skin should try these. i found the packing a little wasteful for an organic product especially. but otherwise for someone who has a normal flow i thought they were nice. they absorb okay so not great for heavy flow but they are comfortable and soft. of you are tired of wearing plastic pads which are more popular in the market this particular pad is just for you first of all its soft so you remain rash free; secondly its odor free so the disgusting smell of your period blood is taken care of; the absorption is also good and it comes with biodegradable disposal bags which are just right for travelling co you won t carry newspapers all the time with you plus its environment friendly so why not no recommend that you must buy this product. i usually have heavy periods thus have to go through some problems during it.due to heavy flow there remains a sticky moist feeling.ah appeared as a rescue for these period troubles.it absorb quickly and the upper layer makes you feel clean.the thing that makes it worth trying is its organic cotton and being free from harmful synthesis and chemicals.i also loved its packing as it is travel friendly without announcing loudly what it is.it is also very easy to dispose it off.now there is no itchy feeling and irritation during periods.is compared to other available sanitary pads i find this expensive.price should be more unfordable to serve more women. of you ask me his is the best product so farno have used different bands so far but nothing can beat this onenan’t say about heavy flow but for first three days flow this sanitary pad is worth the pricenon terms of absorbancy comfort you didn’t even get the feeling you’re using it softness and most importantly dispose systemnew it is worth the priceand it’s packing is very thoughtfulthank you his is the first time i m trying out a product from ah and i must say they are genuinely good. despite their softness and comfort napkins they have made sure that the whole packing and product is environment friendly. even though i have tried a few other organic and biodegradable napkins before i was concerned with the plastic covers they use to pack the individual pads. fortunately ah has solved that problem. i sincerely appreciate it. i m going to be a regular customer of ah for making graceful and quality products. buds to the whole team : his is the best product i have used so far. previously i had tried all types of cotton pads of all big bands but always had rashes problem and discomfort was always there. but oh god this is sooooo amazing. super soft cotton super absorbent and while using it i don’t have the feeling of using a pad it feels like normal thin layer which doesn’t not bother you at all and no additional fragrance is added. i loved the product. ladies this is the solution we should paper ourselves a bit. super soft no irritation. it stands on my expectations. i ve no tense about rashes after using this. vice product the seal of the pack was already broken which is really not acceptable. his is not the first time for me buying this product. value for money and it s a good quality product. very soft and can hold heavy bleeding. north the money using aah felt amazing the product is really comfortable even after wearing it for more than 6 7 hours it’s really soft and didn’t cause any rash either. never thought periods can be so comfortable i’m definitely recommending it to every woman i know. the best part is that it’s safe for both my body as well as the environment. i really liked this product ordered this for first time and trust me i dont regret at all its very soft and doesn feel like or wearing pad not to forget its absorbent u can easily use it for 7 8 hours even if or heavily bleeding and its super soft value for money. itspretty soft pad i really like it but the blue is so strong that when u try to remove the pad it actually opens up and comes apart and that a big mess. i wouldn use this again because of this mess that it makes. it’s been more than a year i have been using this and can’t imagine to use any other brand after this.no comforting and rash free.love the individual packing :smiling face with smiling eyes: i am a menstrual cup and cloth pad user for 3 years now. but i was going on a trip where keeping my reliable products clean wasn t an option. to i bought these of ones for the day. i also bought the xxxl ones for overnight. i have a heavy flow. his absorbed everything and gave me no rashes at all nnot is super thin and soft. it barely feels like you re wearing a pad. and it is so long and wide yes it is costly especially when you are buying it with the disposal pouches. but i recommend the disposal pouches. even if you are a menstrual cup or cloth pad user in extreme winters or heavy rain it is the best option. i highly recommend it i used this pads and they gives safety during our monthly cycle.there is no tension of leakage during heavy flows. buds to team ah for introducing of this product. i am extremely happy with its texture and is very comfortable to use. you don t have to worry about rashes itching and strains. it fits properly as it comes in different sizes and i can use it according to the flow. highly recommendate ah is a much needed product it s super soft on your skin it s organic and more than anything it s extremely user friendly. the design and packing has been well thought and pouches have been provided for disposal which i find very useful. all in all it s a great product and is pocket friendly. : the product is same as promised. the only problem is that of its size. regular pad us if 280 mm that is fir of size pad. i wish it would have been around 230mm like stayfree regular pad. super comfortable during my hard days i love this packing most of all this is unique and movable pad that every girl deserve. his pads are highly comfortable very soft.no rashes. only negative part is adhesive it could ve been better.and wings are also a little small in my opinion. but overall very good i was not sure this would be comparable to my long time favorite brand.i am happy to say after 3 months of using the products they surplus expectations.ecofriendly big with 100 efficacy of products. thank you ah it s really good to use and very soft. but not fully organic. only upper layer is made buy cotton. like that the pads come in mostly biodegradable material and the pad itself os made of cotton. his is the beset gift for any women during those difficult days. it so soft so comfortable that we dont have to worry or remember of any discomfort it s really amazing. it won t give u rashes. i am definitely going to order it again. would request if u can add more pads in box. only thing which was missing was the feel off tape good product great packing comfortable and good absorption and disposal bags makes it even more convenient absolutely loved the product doesn’t feel like you’re wearing a pad due to its softness. to chances of rashes too. i highly recommend every girl to switch to these pads from any and every other brand. excellent product. super soft so no chafing caused by other more synthesis pads. will purchase again. only one drawback the pads can shift around when doing sporting activities . possibly causing a stain. i am using this product since last 3 years these are awesome. but from last 2 3 months the papa get less sickness. it folds while using which cause unvomfortness. very comfortable . very good product and co friendly along with natural ingredient. to toxins that harms the skin or other infections.been using this product from past 1 year. of getting rashes from stayfree whisper and all. must go for this. i used for the first time and didn t get rashes itching or dryness. very good quality and very much comfortable it was too good comfort level it s softness absorbent level. you can have a clean and fresh period with ah sanitary pads. you should go for this one if you are looking for being comfortable and relaxed. yes yes yes. it was really comfortable and soft i does feel irritating and is really light and can absorb really well too. the best sanitary napkin i have ever used. the most amazing thing is it doesn t let you know that your period is going on. like it very much the creativity of thanking note. wonderful concept. good product with comfortable. extremely soft surface product finally found after struggling with rashes for 25 years. thank you to you have something for period pains too lovely product never been disappointed and glad to see that even the slightest feedback is given due consideration. thanks team ah. very easy and comfortable. very good product. letter than nut and all others the pads are really comfortable and packing is also good. it can absorb medium flows.not so good for heavy flows nothing much to say than its comfortableness. roadless is less i m using this product from year ll size pads were really good then nice absorbent and no rashes. but now the quality has gone down for this product it doesn t stand to what it says the rash free periods it does cause rashes for me from months and it leads from the sides.nor now i m shifting to another product but please bring back rash free aah pads n then only i will buy it . i have been using this product for quite some time now and it is very comfortable soft and gentle on my sensitive skin. but the last 2 times i ordered i have seen significant changes in the product. they have changed the blue/stick on the pad which makes it almost impossible to pull it off. the pad gets gripped while trying to pull it off. really nice product.go for it excellent product good the product is fine.nut you can feel the witness after sometime. amazing product i wish i could find it earlier blue was not sticking. comfort was not as good as it used to for a regular napkin too it s too long. the experience of using it is not clumsy at all. to rashes for sure. kings are not rightly signed for napkin to stick where it will stay. it s not biodegradable i believe. part from a paper bag it is also wrapped in a plastic pouch. i am comfortable with safe and soft these are so comforting and fragrance free. must go for it met’s start with the packing minimalistic and elegant package pads come in resealable pouches which i think they could not provide because of lockdown as mentioned in a note i got along with the package but the packet itself is good enough to dispose used pads.ncoming to the absorbency and feel on the skin amazingly soft and you can actually feel that you’re using an organic product. to soft and light whisper has almost always given me rashes/bruises on my skin but this time i did not get any of those things.the size of the of pads are a little larger than the standard size i felt which is a little bigger for me but then i could not find the size l only regular is there which costs the same. :person shrugging light skin tone:u200d:female sign:null in all a very good product and i think i will keep buying this. :smiling face: must love the packing good product overall no rashes amazing first of all would like to say about this products packing.it doesn’t feel like as if this contained sanitary pads. very pad comes in different pouches and can be easily carried around without even anyone letting know that it’s a sanitary pad. will date the pads packets are covered in a black bag and the usual pads doesn’t look good. but the packing itself make it look so good that i was so excited to even try them out. and no wonder they are super soft with good absorbent. i ordered an of size and was fully satisfied with it. a must must use.the pads can be easily thrown in the same packet pouch after usage so no need of even looking for newspapers for wrapping and throwing. to a total thumbs for comfort convenience and softness.i am definitely twitching over to these rather than using the usual ones available in market. an even be used for lifting as the packing is so chin and beautiful :smiling face with heart eyes::zany face: undoubtedly the softness and business with this napkin is par above what readily available in indian markets but my only concern is about the slow absorbing capacity. since i have heavy flow and i often for of pads.i was expecting a it to absorb the discharge just as whisper or stayfree.but was disappointed for same :confused face: very poor quality of blue. the pad doesn t stay in place. the whole emphasis is in the packing.each pad has double covers which is such a waste of material.one of the covers of the pad is the material which is like cloth but is actually plastic. his makes me doubt even if the pad is made of plastic material and sold in the name of cotton. good k type top layer is moist always which doesn t feel good.but softness is good n doesn t cause any rashes. sometimes leads if used during heavy flow. package is excellent for disposal.good environment friendly packing i am happy with the product i always wanted to try biodegradable sanitary napkins since it is good for environment and also good for our body. it is very light and soft for the skin and doesn t cause any galleries or rashes unlike other napkins. it s absorbable capacity is good. for heavy flow i would change every 4 to 5 hours. for normal flow we can wear it for 6 to 7 hours. it comes with disposal covers where we can dispose off the pads easily unlike the other brand where they provide plastic covers. overall i would rate 4 stars for the product. the wings for the pad with adhesive material can be improved . napkin are very thin aborbery.i tried another brand but ah is very comfortable.its softness like cotton .its hygienic because of its organic culture.ll expensive but sometimes we should take care of us most soon ah is very very good because am safi had the to gharwale safi had :winking face::winking face: . i received this sanitary napkin pack this morning the box was open in dissaponntind but of this though all the pads are intact still its looks someone tried to open it or what cut of emergency i can return it otherwise would have done that product seems nice though i had high hopes because my friends had loved ah. badly it didn t work well for me but maybe it s just not a good fit for me . it made me itchy and that was slightly disappointing. ah ultra soft organic sanitary pads comes in both regular and ll size as i was buying it for the first time bought a ll pad had a doubt whether it will absorb well but to my surprise the absorbent is quite good like the ones i have already used. it is super soft and comfortable and dry from the top too. comes with a disposal pack with strap to close it it seems to be plastic bag not sure. it is one of the best organic cotton pads i have used. to give it a try girls. have been using it for almost a year now and i really love this product. absolutely comfortable no rashes and the absorption capacity is much higher compared to other cotton/organic pads.nthe packing is fantastic too have noticed that they have changed to a normal paper packing of pads rather than the glossy finish. but all in all great product and would highly recommend glad to use a women product that is designed with utmost care. ah ultra soft organic pads are a revolution in themselves. they are super soft to use and do not cause the usual irritation and rashes the other pads cause. the packing is too apt and now you don t have to hide it to take it to the office mushroom. one pad lasts for god 4 5 his so good capacity to handle the flow. and the best part is they are easy to decomposes. to try this guilt free option and make yourself and your surroundings feel good. moved these they re soft and airy light and super absorbent. the disposal covers are great to carry around as well. definitely recommend to avoid the issue in future and making things easy and comfortable girls go for it. the packing is really nice. although the pad size could be bigger. it seems to be little costly but serves it purpose. to sure if these pads will absorb heavy flow. of in that case you need to change. environment friendly pad you can go for it for the goodness of society. fig :thumbs up:for cotton pad. to for it guns quality of product is very nice. i always had issue of rash due to pads but this product have very soft material and adhesion are also very. love this product. well designed comfortable pads. only issue is that the adhesive is a bit too strong. other than that it’s a great product.,https://www.amazon.in/Azah-Ultra-soft-Organic-Sanitary-12/dp/B07K9QT5K8/ref=sr_1_30?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.8R6EGJQFiIqkpTPz1DC2A36C1DmXFgSoBO4oV7KNfup7EhKMwmdIUB478NPlSRAjE6FOccaU0N2rkOXy2V66aUY0NLc3IzzQEMX9lepXi_4ZBxyae1cw94t3iacrIK58XMcsl9uZAhgaUlEmGCnHMRf8BvUJ8b-MHzb5myyhiwV_JKzq7cRPDM3swFHyU8y4sY0VVNsQqxGsywapByVkXueToSzLnqvisZ8Ho8oP4P0eNa0aouem4_Bs9szGZ55a0BxeLKdsZeSdvaTFb_iguDVbj-zhzHOHJNzCHL4Xx7c.RsreRBTLyQTBFIIMYqNWja8EV8TL9-nPM5hld5-PEWA&dib_tag=se&keywords=women+sanitary+products&qid=1722584188&sr=8-30,0.27184917869586883,0.219,0.096,0.685,1.0

B07Q4R2CNZ,"Organic Pads for Women - Maxi Pads with Wings, Sanitary Pads for Women, Feminine Pads, Thin Menstrual Pads That Can Also Be Worn Overnight, Feminine Hygiene Products by My Box Shop (20 Count)","3,257.00",4.5 out of 5 stars,366 ratings,"Looking to cut down on toxins? So were we. My Box Shop is a women-owned and operated company bringing cleaner, healthier, organic alternatives to big brand name tampons, pads and liners. When we discovered how many chemicals, dyes, bleaches and preservatives were in our feminine care products we quickly realized our most sensitive areas were being exposed to terrible toxins on a monthly basis. We are always fragrance-free period pads and instead of synthetic fibers we use 100% organic cotton. Our maxi pads are ultra thin and have a certified organic cotton top sheet. Keeping nasty dyes, chemicals bleaches off of you. No one needs to subject themselves to toxins, we are geared to change that for everyone.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71Yvlno3d5L._SX679_.jpg,i have an extremely bad adhesive clergy and can t use any sort of glued. and most pads cause burns to my skin. but these don t i was so happy to find a brand that doesn t make my skin melt off the only pad i want to use anymore to leads or masses they always stay in place minimal plastic and no strange fragrance added. i am an aid seeker of all things non toxic deodorant skin care feminine care and write reviews on all the great ones i find. his is one of those great responsible products.no noticed this pad does not leave me irritated like some pads do. it got to the point where i stopped wearing pads all together. i can’t quite figure out why but there’s a noticeable difference with these pads and this is a major plus point for me.no’ve been using these as overnight pads but i don’t have extremely heavy periods so i’m not sure it will work as an overnight pad for everyone. i am hoping this company develops one no love the tampons as well.non a less significant note the packing is discrete/minimalistic but pretty so i don’t mind having the boxes displayed on my bathroom shelf. that i like about these is the wrapping it isn t loud when you wrap them and it s small compared to the note brand. i like the feel of them they re a little softer than the note ones which makes them slightly more comfortable than note. normally i only wear the same pair of jeans when i use a pad cause my others make it very uncomfortable but i was able to wear a different pair of jeans without problems. though the jeans i wore were little more loose fitting. i like the adhesive it s not too sticky but not too weak.they absorb okay i guess but the note ones hold out way longer than these. by flow isn t heavy but my first night i wore note over these cause the note holds out longer in my opinion. to over all are they better than the note ones well i like the softer feel of them over the rougher note ones but i like how the note absorb over these so in my opinion they come out even for me. these are so comfortable i want to wear them daily they are incredibly soft and they don’t irritate me like other pads do. :red heart: thank you i ve been slowly going organic on my skin care deodorant hair care already eating healthy and the next step was my party liners and pads. i am so happy i found this company i ve let my mon and sister try them and they both loved these too along with the pads . it comes in a cut box individually wrapped and just clean. plus the line has no chemical odor and i feel fresh. highly recommend these i ve just placed my second order these pads are great. i was a bit nervous that they would leak on my heavier days but they never did i love the idea of having organic beauty products and this was the next step in that journey for me. it came in a pack of three which will last me about 3 1/2 months with a regular not extremely heavy flow with my period lasting about 6 days. will definitely be repurchasing update: the still loves them and we are re ordering monthly.nfeedback from my 12 year old who has had her period for over a year and has tried a dozen different style. the said they are more comfortable than store bought. the ones from the store make me feel like i am wearing a dinner and they are organic which is great. i like these well enough because they are absorbent enough for what i need. i like that they are more natural compared to the genetic option on shelves. by complaints with these are that the wings are not very adhesive. they come loose or shift throughout the day. another thing i am not a fan of is that these are very long for pads that are supposedly for moderate flow. sometimes these felt like wearing a dinner which is not my favorite. i suppose i can t be too pick when it comes to choosing a natural feminine product. all that to say these are not my favorite but not a bad option at all. must up to personal preference. good purchase but not the best of all. does the job no irritating feeling.but it doesn t adhere as good depending on the material of the underwear and also the cotton part of the pad comes apart a bit and you have to get it off from your outer lady part.but not as annoying as it sounds.but good overall. i love that is not too big that is organic cotton and that it absorb really well. however the back tends to come off after a while of using it. that is why i took 1 star off. i can barely feel them i like them a lot. they say they are marie pads which i wouldn’t call them that but they are good for every day wear. i would give them four an a half stars but it won’t let me these are great. very comfortable and wonderful adhesive. the only issue i had was the length. while great during the day not so good at night. they are just not long enough for sleeping during your period. i’m so happy that there are finally good organic tampons and feminine products available. i stopped using tampons years ago because i noticed i had worse menstrual pains when using them. i had no idea it was because they weren’t organic and it was from the toxins in the cotton. these work perfectly and don’t cause the pain of traditional tampons. i will absolutely purchase these again. i love these tampons i have been wanting to go the organic route for years but hated the ones on the market without an application. these tampons are super absorbent. they work just as well and the non organic ones i have been using in the super size. i will continue to use these tampons and have already ordered the pads and pantyliners from this line these pads are great thin but great absorbent and the best part for me was the materials used. i am striving to make switches to all things more natural so these definitely fit the bill. it s amazing what is conventional stuff once you start really looking and when something is touching a sensitive area you want it to be as safe as possible. you won t be disappointed i love these pads his is the third brand i have tried and i have finally found one i love. they absorb very well so i don’t feel nasty every time my body release. they are also not super thick but hold up well for a heavy day. i highly recommend these if you are looking for an organic pad. i always have worn pads and tampons but they made me feel fresh and wouldn hold. his pad i domo have to change all day it doesn t leak when i lookout and i am a 200 lb woman so its not easy for me to find something that fits. am so happy i found these. these were nice soft and comfortable for the most part. they arrived quick. the only thing i can say bad was that the adhesive on them is really strong and almost pulls your underwear apart . about a year ago i switched to organic pads and tampons after a friend recommended i try them to help with cramps. it helped tremendous. i bought these online as an alternative because i couldn’t find any in my local grocer store in the city i moved to. did not disappoint plus. the packing is cut will be repurchasing. these are super absorbent and you would think it by just looking at the actual pad. looks are definitely deceiving. for someone with an extremely heavy flow this is exactly what i needed. the fact that they are organic cotton and made with natural things makes it a to trainer. i ve finally found the pad that works for he. now i have been looking for pads that stick well and don’t shift while i’m working out or sleeping and these are great. i don’t have any skin irritation. it doesn’t feel like dinner rash. they are soft no odor and stick and absorb well love these organic pads i stopped using pads for a while because i just started really disliking the main stream and chemical ly brand that i was using. but since finding these i m really pleased and will always keep them stocked for those days when i just don t want to use a campan. definitely recommend these. i am trying to be more conscientious of what i use in general and try to go organic and natural as much as possible. with that i tried this product and found that it was just as great as the always brand i had used before. these are great. highly recommend that can you say about a pad it s organic that s good. i don t like chemicals on my skin. these are absorbent and do the job. of your cycle is super heavy you might need to change them more often than the chemical pads not sure but they worked great for me. i am forever changed after a recent miscarriage i totally changed my outlook on toxins and all the crazy stuff we put in or on our body that we just overlook these pads were so light but very absorbent. love them and will be ordering them again and again these are great. i was looking for a wealthier option and these are it definitely recommend. they’re comfortable to put in and there’s no leakage. they’re also not too thick which i was worried about. must stocked up again his is a nice alternative to chemical pads. they work great and give you peace of mind when having something so close to your body. they also have a subscription that lowers the price a little bit and now i won’t forget and run out the pads are ok. not fabulous. but the packing is outrageous and offensive to anyone who is concerned about their footprints like me. i bought these because they are supposedly organic and i don t want toxins touching my lady parts. they are comfortable enough but very small and short. however they would fit a turf perfectly. were s the kicked the extreme amount of plastic packing the pads are individually wrapped in plastic trappers that cannot be recycle; then the plastic wrapped pads are contained in 2 non recyclable boxes; then the boxes come in a plastic bag that cannot be recycle. that what everything is wrapped in plastic and nothing is recyclable and must be thrown into a landfill. surely in the must century the manufacturer can do so much better than this the pad just isn t worth the damage to the environment. all this plastic will end up in our ocean. i won t buy again. these are my new favorite pads. they are thick but not too thick and good for day or overnight. i wish the wings were slightly longer but other then that they are great. also they are so soft and seriously the best quality of pads. highly recommend. love these pads. you can trust you are taking good care of your body with them being organic. plus the color makes you feel happy even when you are moody. they are thin and comfortable. average absorbent for organic pads. i had no problem with these pads they work great and make me feel good. the next time i need a bigger size though. of you have a heavy flow you need a larger size these are great i was a little worried about how they would handle heavier flow but i ve just had to switch them once or twice more which is nothing in the face of the comfort and more earth friendly pad i love these pads. less irritation than the pads i normally use. i decided to try these because they had good reviews and women said they did not have irritation. i am very pleased with these pads. i am in love with these pads. i will not use another brand again. they are so comfortable. other pads were leaving me irritated which does not happen with these organic pads. to happy to have found these. definitely a quality product feels like real cotton and doesn t irritate my skin or make me uncomfortable during my monthly cycle. having a product you can trust as far as manufacturing and ingredient goes is so important in this day and age. needed some pads for after a rectocele surgery these have been great. they are so soft. they absorb great. and they stick great with the side wings. i’m glad i ordered these. these are adorable made for people who have a very light period. the pads are short like a little longer than my hand .definitely not for women that have a heavier flow. they are good for the end of my period. i would recommend these for a teenager by periods were heavy after i gave birth. literally soon as i made the switch my cramps were gone and my period is so much lighter and they stay in place these are great high quality maxim pads. there s nothing i would do to improve on these great pads. they are perfect for normal days. they stayed stuck and i didn t have any leakage . perfect pad that won t let you down. very comfortable and smooth scented. i love how it is made with cotton. i was afraid that it wouldn t absorb as good as the old ones i used but surprisingly it works wonderful love these to munching or pad edges. they works great and feel great hardly know it’s there i live a clean/green lifestyle i love these are organic. i also love the feminine packing. an’t wait for their tampons the best quality of cotton padney skin is sensitive and i tried this one and it was amazing so soft and come no’ll keep using this pad thank you i like that they were organic but they had a strange smell to them when i opened it. also not very absorbent. i may use them again on lighter period days when i’m just sporting i love these pads. they are perfect for my light days i won’t use anything else. the quality is amazing and they’re fairly prices. not these for my 13 year old. the likes how thin and soft they are. i love how natural and healthy they are. 1000 worth it i m very happy with these i like the absorbent of this regular pad. it doesn t make you feel icy or have that feeling of witness. to far so good. tommy got here quickly cut little nondescript box no edges. may. :slightly smiling face: very happy with my purchase. of my pick 12 year old loves them i m hooked. and i feel so good going the organic route they re not bulky and soft like cotton indies. the pads are very absorbent and very comfortable. a wonderful feminine product. i intend to continue using them. i used these in the weeks following delivering a baby. good quality would definitely buy again. i am so happy i found a great organic product to use thanks so much i no longer have to be worried about harsh chemicals and eyes. may super pretty packing. the pads are very comfortable. the only thing is not as absorbent. it’s great for light flow. having more than a couple option available on amazon is amazing. myboxshop has been my favorite so far. the pads are thin and comfortable and easy to wear. these pads are super soft and comfortable. i order another brand and they are not as soft. i will be twitching to these for sure i m amazed that i can actually tell the difference with the organic cotton pads. such more comfortable and gives me peace of mind too must used these for my most recent period and i loved them they’re super absorbent but not crazy thick. also love that they’re organic these are exactly as they should be not too bulky very absorbent. will order these again. wont have any complaints. like that its organic cotton and not filled with the usual ruddy toxic materials. wish they had wings as longer other than that they were fine the most comfortable period i have ever had very nice it s super thin and come. to skin irritation. very absorbent. these pads fit very comfortably and i don’t feel like i have one on at all these pads are wonderful great fit and felt secure wearing them on my light days. very come won’t leak and moreover is cruelty free: super comfortable and soft. to more plastic feels great great product love how it’s organic 2/4 arrived extremely missed up. update: is much as i loved these at first i started to have a major reaction. a really bad burning and itchy sensation. unfortunately i won t buy these again. i had to only give a one star due to how severe of a reaction i got.nthese are wonderful i use these for light days. i don t have a reaction and would definitely be buying these again. very comfortable i really like these pads the product is presented really nicely but it is not a maxim pad. it is very thin and comfortable. it’s more like a line for me. i wouldn’t use it during my heavier flow days. great product. happy i found this organic option. comfortable good absorption and adhesion awesome feeling. very comfortable. to sorry these pads weren’t what i wanted i’m going to use them for dusting :double exclamation mark: very nice. great product very nice product what i did like was the acuteness of the pads. packing. my major dislike was that they were small and not absorbent. break very easily. just terrible pad.nni would not recommend them.ni will not be purchasing them again i absolutely love their pantyliners but not the pads the pad didn t hold up and the corners didn t keep the blood from spreading everywhere. i ll

month. i m a new mon started using this a week after delivery. it is so soft and comfortable unlike other regular pads. whenever i used regular pads earlier i used to get rashes. but this even after one month i m very comfortable. the only drawback is it has no side wings comfortable useful for paternity very useful after delivery when flow is high. comfortable soft material. not recommend. thanks for the quality these pad are best for postpartum period comfortable easy to use big size the quality and length is good and useful for paternity periods it delivery time this is very useful mon s feel free so go for it good for postpartum use. lads are large and highly absorbent must buy this product after delivery 100 happy and satisfied you. very soft pads and super comfortable. did not hurt my c section scars at all and served the purpose very well. also no rash was caused with these pads. it’s too very big to place inside party and gum comes off easily so does not stick into party it’s very uncomfortableno bought it and tried to use after my delivery but could not use more than 2 pads size not good but quality wise ok must buy quality is good but falls off from pad fixation difficult to use not worth for this price good his is the best one for paternity time. it s very thick which i m ok with. highly recommendable for postnatal use. after my c section i used this product and it gives very comfortable feeling giving protection to your incision area . i am just writing this review because the product is amazing. super useful after delivery. but i don’t know product i got is old or what i can’t remove the tape behind the pad because it’s coming out with pad cotton. in all pads it’s same so i am using it without removing the tape. very comfortable west for initial days of delivery.very big soft. didn t feel any discomfort . like others . definitely buy for starting period of delivery . the pads are really comfortable big and adjustable. i would suggest go for it good doesn’t stay in place better to go for other party style pads postpartum must buy very god product. must have . literally best sanitary napkins for paternity. after postpartum. west after post delivery. to need to change frequently. had is so soft n comfortable.super absorbent power 1 pad is enough for 1 day/6 8 hours.no for it or buy for new tom sof you have habit to frequently change the had in hours then 8 10 pads are enoughvery large in size no tension of dots n stains. useful a little bit about me i m an over weight person and my usual period flow is also on the heavier side so was my postpartum period flow.nno used these pads for the first 40 days and these were a boon. the pads are really soft no irritation and covered my whole pelvic area which ensued no leakage.nnone thing to note these don t have wings. to you need a proper wider base party to use it. or can buy the disposal parties as well.nwill definitely recommend. i tried too many other local brand but no one is great as this product.nnest product after delivery use . lads do not have wings to hold the pad in place. though absorbent is good cannot be used for long as it will not stay in place and cause irritation and leakage. it is really comfortable for postpartum. 100 recommend this product for new moss not does the job real good. product is top quality and it provides the much needed comfort during initial days of delivery. quality is too good.very needed in post pregnancy time.happy to buy these pads are helpful for the first 2 3 days after delivery. thereafter you can use normal pads. these are soft to skin and good absorption. the size of the pads are slightly big than regular pads so keep in mind before buying. good product very very very helpful pads after deliveryn15pad use k bad dura order or k 15 pad or mngwayi h .so good quality used this post lscs for 2 weeks. excellent absorbent comfort size fit. it helps you forget a significant part of body changes pertaining to bleeding or involuntary urine passage and let you focus on your little one. it s width is same throughout its length which makes it more convenient for postpartum use. to need to figure out which end will sit where. it s also extremely soft and it s presence will not bother you at all. fig size aids further in coverage absorption. i took a huge chance of ordering only this brand while pressing my hospital bag and i don t regret it one bit. to for it product is super useful in post delivery. it has very soft layer doesn t feel itchy at all. highly recommended. good products.its very soft and comfortable.:thumbs up: very comfortable and perfect size. to for it good enough to come north money these pads are very soft and comfortable. absorbency is ok. these are useful only if the bleeding is heavy otherwise normal pads are enough. gene and baby delivery pe order king the so do bar to ache the but rd time mangaya to wo defective milkavaska blue in strong had i pad fat data had n waste gay useful and good in quality after c. section must need this . after c section paternity pads must need this one is suit for that i used it right after my c section in the hospital it was good for heavy bleeding good i used 3 4 days after delivery baby. these pads are god blessings for me. without these pads my postpartum period could be a disaster. these are large enough and made of pure cotton so you can completely rely upon it. it s very comfortable. thank very much. i love it. everyone must go for it for their postpartum period. i bought this package for my paternity purposes. yes the size is very big but it is so soft while using after delivery. the package was good so i ordered the next package as the first one got over. the disadvantage is the pad easily gets small at the middle portion so i need to change the pad frequently for better comfort. in the whole it is a good one for after delivery purposes. his paternity pad is very beneficial for new mon no leakage at all. i wish i had bought these pads before i gave birth so i could use them for the first three days post part when they’d really come of use rather than 10 days later. that being said the pads were quite uncomfortable to wear as they were very bulky. maybe the effectiveness in the first few days would justify the bulk and discomfort. vice in seeing.actual review can mention when it is being used quality of the cotton is exceptional :smiling face with heart eyes: soft product. resists overflow easily. helps in comforting stitches due to normal delivery. k i bought these pads reading the reviews. these were not at all effective for me as i had vaginal delivery which lead to perennial stitches using these at that time was so uncomfortable plus the absorption is also not that great. to for disposal parties they were a huge hit with me. comfortable to wear and very good product for new moss. very good quality product for after delivery nice product it might not be much useful as hospital provides this kind of pads. buy it only if heavy soiling is expected as per past experience periods time .buying this pack all lads may be useful. so buy a small packet.andros good absorbent for heavy soiling.none very big in size. uncomfortable to carry sum is placed in center so pad moves away from center if used with normal any/disposal party. after c section i used this for 5 days. left and right side sticky rapier is not there in this product.back side sticky rapier is helpful to stick the pad.but at the same time both the side sticky rapier is needed. otherwise pad will fold little both the side. i used those post delivery. and they were really helpful for my tough days. by heavy flow last for 1 2 weeks only. to they are good for heavy flow only. afterwards you can use normal pads. size is large good recommended to all it was very much useful. i was able to use it throughout night as well the pads are very useful. i will suggest as i have used at hospital. very comfortable after c section . heavy flow period time also it is very useful i received the package on time. the pad is really very soft just like stay free sanitary pads top sheet. length is also good. 2 things i don t like are the adhesive on the back side is very small and i don t think it will be a great fit and no side wings to hold protect the pad from fixing in a stable position. i m convinced because it is dermatologically tested and due to delivery and tiredness we won t keep moving so i hope this pad will fix for staying calm in bed and do justice for the product. i have used this paternity pads recently and it’s so comfortable for postpartum bleeding. i have used other bands pads too but comparing other bands this is best soft paternity pad even though it is huge pad but it does not serve the purpose of heavy flow. all the liquid stays only in the one centre place and if flow is heavy there is tendency is leak sideways in the middle of the pad. it s irritating that it s so huge and doesn t serve the purpose of it. will never buy this pad again. also it s uncomfortable to use that regular sanitary pads which we use for periods. i would suggest go for any other normal sanitary pads than this one. these paternity pads are so soft and high quality. i have tried other bands this one is the best. on t think twice if or going to deliver a baby. u need it for first 7 days for that heavy flow. i had a great comfort because of its absorbancy. i will surely recommend it to new moss. its really a very big pad.not good for your initial days at the hospital n even for st period after delivery.not is large size length n breadth wise so it doesn t leak anyhow u sleep with it. to no dirty sundry n no spots on bedsheets. very useful padso soft and comfortable :thumbs up:very nice :thumbs up::smiling face with hearts::thumbs up:no love this very good and soft use it after my c section serves the purpose good very comfortable and absorbent . saved a lot embarrassment it s absorption is quite good but wings are not provided.need to be conscious while using it. kissing comfort.nand i had c section and my flow is medium so not much useful for me.nnot will be good who have huge flow after delivery. amazing pads very long and soft as per the descriptionhappy with the product i ordered them after seeing reviews was not sure but these are the best paternity pads. i would suggest please take them at the time of your delivery they will give you comfort no itching no rashes . even that time flow these pads can handle.no liked them very much. superb product. must have after delivery i used it right after my c section. the cotton in the pad gets very hard and flogged causing discomfort. i only used one pad. super wastage its best i had a c section delivery and these paternity made are proving to be quite comfortable. the length and softness of these pads make it very easy to wear. in an average it takes around 2 3 pads per day. i delivered normally about two weeks ago and wore these pads immediately following my delivery. they are big in size but this is needed immediately as the bleeding tends to be quite heavy. it does a great job of absorbing even the heavy flow. west part is the pads are so soft they do not irritate the sutures even on the early days when the site of episiotomy can be painful and tender. use it with mesh underwear for a haste wash free first few days. good quality good absorption the nurses were wondering after my c section that this bad actually absorbed blood for a whole day and not needed frequently changing. it saved me really very nice product :thumbs up::thumbs up::check mark button: absorbency is amazing. but i felt it oversized must go for it,https://www.amazon.in/sspa/click?ie=UTF8&spc=MToxMzQ4NjY5ODQwNjYxMjcyOjE3MjI1ODQxODk6c3BfYnRmOjMwMDAyMTk0NTgxMzgzMjo6MDo6&url=%2FMaternity-Absorption-Disposable-After-Delivery-Incontinence%2Fdp%2FB0C1KD5GS1%2Fref%3Dsr_1_57_sspa%3Fdib%3DeyJ2IjoiMSJ9.8R6EGJQFiIqkpTPz1DC2A36C1DmXFgSoBO4oV7KNfup7EhKMwmdIUB478NPlSRAjE6FOccaU0N2rkOXy2V66aUY0NLc3IzzQEMX9lepXi_4ZBxyae1cw94t3iacrIK58XMcsl9uZAhgaUlEmGCnHMRf8BvUJ8b-MHzb5myyhiwV_JKzq7cRPDM3swFHyU8y4sY0VVNsQqxGsywapByVkXueToSzLnqvisZ8Ho8oP4P0eNa0aouem4_Bs9szGZ55a0BxeLKdsZeSdvaTFb_iguDVbj-zhzHOHJNzCHL4Xx7c.RsreRBTLyQTBFIIMYqNWja8EV8TL9-nPM5hld5-PEWA%26dib_tag%3Dse%26keywords%3Dwomen%2Bsanitary%2Bproducts%26qid%3D1722584188%26sr%3D8-57-spons%26sp_csd%3Dd2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9idGY%26psc%3D1,0.2851967798283589,0.263,0.062,0.675,1.0

never going back to my old brand. soft comfortable i am a frequent user of pua pads and have found them to be exceptionally comfortable especially with the addition of disposal bags. his feature is unique and impressive because disposing of pads while on the go can be quite challenging. thanks to pua pads we used to receive pads with bags included making disposal haste free.nhowever i was surprised to receive a packet of 32 of pads without any disposal bags included. by main reason for ordering was to ensure i had proper bags for disposal. it s very disappointing to see the pads

horrible as it sounds. i have tried dozens of different pads of different companies and nothing works. and on top of that i have very minimal period etiquette. which is to say i have none. to even 10 years since my first cycle i still end up staining my clothes.nno ve been trying to convince my mon to allow me to use a menstrual cup for years since i first saw the first soon up advertisement in 2015 and its only now that she s finally allowed me. to mind you i was quite determined to get it to work.nformed with the knowledge of hundreds of articles about what to do and what not to do i go into the mushroom on my first day of bleeding.nand.nno won t lie. it wasn t easy. i was in the bathroom for 45 minutes hot shower running to calm myself and another attempt just piling upon the previous attempts.nno tries.nthe first one i tried with a c fold but it was too big for my vaginal opening and the second attempt was made with a 7 fold whose tip made it inside before i got too uncomfortable and pulled out. the third attempt was with a punch down fold which was just the ideal size but again my opening was too small. by the fourth time my muscles had clamped up and nothing was going inside. th try was a throw away before i was giving up for the day. to i stop. stand under the shower and somehow i ve decided that tomorrow just sounds like a good idea. it would be my second day and that means more blood and more publication and an easier time to get it inside. the th try was just another attempt because my muscles had relaxed and i decided to surprise my vagina. and it kind of worked. i read an article where they said to push the cup towards your back and not up so the th try was supposed to be just another try that worked the cup was in nthe next 7 hours were heavenly. i constantly checked on myself to see if i was leaking or not because i have just never felt like this on my periods. over. before. but i did not. weak that is.nno now it was 7 hours past and i have to remove it and empty it. i did what the pamphlet of the cup told me to do push with my muscles and grab hold of the bottom of the cup and pinch it to pull out. did it work well no. the pitching worked in the most vague definition of working. it released a miniscule amount of pressure but the suction still existed. by the time i d pulled about a third of it out my vagina hated me and the suction felt like i was going to die. but the key is to not panic. i shoved two fingers inside and just pressed the body of the cup and with a hiss the suction died and the cup was out i was having a major utf moment but i did wash up and try to push the cup back in. and it did go inside in the very first attempt now that i had that technique down pat. but i could feel the cup inside me. clearly i had bruised my inner walls with my horrendous removal technique.nno i do what all women in such a situation does i went to rmenstrualcup.nthere i was told by a fellow citizen that a certain but in hotdog method should work. of i knew who that person was i d send them flowers because work it did by second attempt happened within seconds i pushed with my vaginal muscles until the stem was out and then relaxed and wriggled my middle fingers in along the walls of the cup pressing them towards its center. the moment i reached the rim of the cup i just pushed it inside itself and voila the suction is gone and then you just push with your muscles and the cup doth escape the cave nno m on my th day of the first cycle as of writing this review and the last three days have been the best periods of my life. i m officially converted and am never going back to sanitary pads. over.nnedit: it is my second cycle and the cup is being very stubborn. it refuses to open easily inside me and so i ve leaned. i will have to see if this is something that persists. also i m beginning to find the bottom design of the cup incredibly annoying as the little round of the stem is not as spherical as advertised instead is a hollow bowl shape that keeps on pitching me as my croix has dropped a few millimetres and is incredibly uncomfortable. the design team should take a look at that because i don t think sacrificing the comfort of the customer in lieu of cutting costs at the production is a smart idea. very good product the one who has heavy flow should definitely try. is i am 17 years old girl. and never ever had any sex or physical activities i was too scared to try this product but after watching several youtube video i finally decided to purchase a menstrual cup. when came the task to choose which menstrual cup should i use so that it fits me right. i watched a video of see safe menstrual up and saw that extra small is also available in it and it is specially made for teenager under 18 years of age. i was happy that finally i found a cup which is of my type. but still i was a little confused that i am 17 and after a few months i ll be 18 and then i ll have to use the small one so i searched literally everywhere that which size should i choose and finally i got to the see safe main web site and there was a feature to chat with one of their executive. to i consulted to them and they suggested me to use the extra small one. to i ordered this product. and guess what i received it on the second day of my period that is today. i used it in morning and here i m writing the review. i was getting into the bathroom for bath and suddenly the delivery boy came and i rushed to pick my order. i was happy that moment. i unvexed the cup and was surprised by seeing the size. i thought that it would be a little bigger than what i received and i got happy after seeing that the size is even smaller than what i imagined. when i took bath. after that i boiled my cup for 3 minutes and starting to out it in. i tried the punchdown fold and it didn t entered my vagina. when i tried the labia fold it was too tough to hold it in that fold. when i tried the c fold and entered it and successfully it entered but after that it was not opened and i couldn t put my two fingers inside as my hole is small. i took it out and once again tried the punchdown fold and this time it tried it forceful from the base to enter my vagina and it entered in 1 or 2 minutes and i pushed it inside and it went up to the croix. when i got out of the bathroom. it was painful inside and as i always watched the youtube and they always said it wouldn t feel anything after applying it but i was feeling pain and continuously i was feeling that something is inside me and i thought it is not opened properly that why it s hurting inside and stepped in the bathroom and tried pulling it out but as i was pulling the stem of it it was not coming down because it was already opened properly and it had the suction that was not allowing it to come down. i tried it very roughly and then thought if i ll do it continuously and pull it roughly like this i would break the stem may be so i relaxed myself and used my abdominal muscle to push it down as we do while popping and seeing and it easily went down i hold it from the base and pulled it out. after that i cleaned the cup and inserted it again but then also i was feeling pain and couldn t put it inside after trying hard for 10 minutes i decided to give on it up but then i thought one more time and tried it and it entered thankful. after that i have not taken it out yet and it is already 7 hours i ll take it out after 11 hours and will see what happens. i m still happy that i least tried to use it and successfully used it in very first time. i ve also used a pantyliner just to be a little sure of any leakage. it has not leaned till now. to i think it is a great product to have. and the pain i felt was because of my muscles down there because i ve never used anything inside and never had any sex in life so my muscles are really tight and that s why it am feeling pain but i think i will get used to it in some days. and the fact that i used it successfully in very first time is enough for me. to girls what are you thinking of order it fearlessly but first check your size and consult it to the customer care service of that cup. of you re a teenager like me u can definitely use see safe for sure. you ll never regret it. and thank me later. of this review helped you please like it. it is one of the contest cups i have used. it is very comfortable and easy to use. after a certain while you forget that it exists and also you forget about all the uncomfortable situations faced earlier with pads and other stuff. definitely recommended u now but ajeeb lata had is to use anna but pain full had .ye mere experience had been ages to is nasi anna chaise.and hum issue over flow k time use nasi war sake .but bald full sonata had and leakage hi one lata had .our body k and onset anna .but pushkin had our final hi but pushkin had .its a very pain full product .i can suggest you eyes .plan not by it:pleading face: i got this product yesterday and it was my first day of periods. was sacred to try it on but trust me guns this has changed my life it is a must try on productno easy to use itvery girl should try thismoved it this is going to be a long review and it s especially for girls like me who are teenager but are scared to even put a finger down in your vagina. first things first the product is really nice i m 18 years old so i bought the extra short one but after using it i realised my croix is pretty high but still if you re pondering over whether or not to buy this just go for it.now the next thing if you re scared to use it but you do want to change from sanitary pads/tampons to menstrual cups then let me tell you it s not going to be easy. especially if this is the first time you re going to use it. it took me a like 2 hours and 3 trials to get it successfully inside my vagina. once you put it inside you won t feel anything maybe a little bit uncomfortable for a few minutes but then you won t even realise you ve something sitting inside your vagina. it s super comfortable. so just go for it you won t regret.nor the procedure to put it inside you should know the punch down fold c fold felt a lot scar for me to use for the first time so i really recommend punch down fold . met in a comfortable position squat down and take deep breath to relax yourself. don t tense your muscles otherwise it s going to be really tough to get it inside. use the small diameter of punch down fold of the cup to slowly get it inside and it may hurt a little bit so before doing that try inserting a finger. i tried with my pink finger so you can do that too. when with your dominant hand insert it inside until the folded portion of the cup is inside and then slowly get it more inside. the stem of the cup must be inside your vagina properly too.of you ve a short croix then i d recommend you buy a cup of your size or either trim the stem out. when you ll probably hear a pop sound of the cup opening up or maybe not because i didn t hear it th . to check if the cup has created the required suction insert a finger and try to pull the stem really gently don t pull it too hard if you can t move the cup then voila the suction is created and you re ready for the day but for safety measures if you re using it for first time you should probably still keep sanitary pads with you.the next problem will be creating the suction my cup just wouldn t open up after getting inside. in this case just try changing portions or maybe try changing the fold you re using for your cup. for the first day i just gave up because it just didn t open but the next day it finally did. to don t give up it will work out for you. i was really scared of using it too but here i am after using it a single time and it was a good experience apart from all the failures and stress i put my body through :skull: next problem which might arise is removal of the cup you may find that cup has gone too high which happened with me and i creaked out . first things first don t freak out. it s still there just try inserting a finger and look for the stem. of you found the stem then slowly go up with that index finger and find the top of the cup and try to push on one side of the cup to break the suction. once you ve done it with that single finger try to wriggle the cup down slowly trust me it worked for me. must don t remove your finger from the top of the cup keep pressing the cup to break the suction and gently bring it down. that s what i did because the idea of inserting a thumb and index finger inside was too much for me.no hope this helped any one of you and i hope you don t have too much trouble with using it letter than many other bands. it fits so well that some times you don’t even feel that u have used something there. value for money. moved this product easy to use to for it good product it s good but sometimes vacuum it creates is too much. you are unable to take out the cup also stem is small.need improvement i m writing this review after using a medium size cup for 8 months. the product worked fine until today when the tip of the bottom of the cup broke off while trying to remove it from my vagina. the cup was meant to last for more than a couple years as the co. claims but now it needs to be discarded. wouldn t recommend see safe but would definitely recommend using menstrual cups. his is a super long review but might be helpful for a : after reading up and watching a ton on video and giving a lot of thought about twitching to a menstrual cup i ordered the see safe menstrual up small from here.after receiving the package whose outer cardboard box was torn and damaged please take notes amazon i went forward to examine the cup which was in a sealed packet inside the spade bag. the cup thankful was completely damaged.next i went forward to try the cup once i was still few days away from my periods . i opened the sealed package sterilised the cup as mentioned in the manual and then went ahead to try it in.honestly it was kind of a task. it at least took me 5 10 minutes to get myself to make the correct folds i tried the c fold and the lunch down fold . anyway somehow i then went ahead to insert it inside it took some effort there too of course but i was able to do it after few tries. still however i wasn’t sure if the cup had opened inside no apparent pop sound which i later read doesn’t always happen also it felt it being a bit weird in my vagina. i’d read it should feel like there’s nothing at all inside your vagina but it definitely felt like something. i watched few more video related to it and then went ahead to try it again. his time i realised the cup had opened not because i heard the pop sound but because i could feel the suction/vacuum when i tried moving the cup once it was inside this is the most accurate measure to make sure the cup has opened inside but again the cup still felt a little weird when i sat stood up or walked. i thought maybe this is how it is and let it be.last forward the day i got my periods i again sterilised the cup never skin this before the start of your cycle . i again went ahead to try the lunch down fold and oh with clean hands mind you always always wash your hands super clean before you either put it in or take it out. anyway so i then put it inside my vagina this time somehow it was easier it definitely took less time and effort. i then tried moving it once it was properly inside it didn’t move meaning the vacuum had been created and hence it was opened. all good. now the most surprising and ironic thing that happened here was this time the cup felt super comfortable inside like i had read everywhere. it was exactly like there wasn’t anything at all inside. now i don’t know why it was not the same the first day i tried it. now for the taking it out part that was definitely easier. i sat on the toilet and using my thumb and index finger i pinched the part just above the stalk of the cup to release the vacuum and slowly pulled it down and out. the fact that you’re sitting on the toilet helps so that even if the blood pills while you’re taking the cup out you don’t really make a mess.nor the next 3 days till the end of my cycle i used it of i took it out to clean after every 6 8 hours super comfortably.no’m so so glad i took the plunge and switched to something sustainable and co friendly and honestly ₹499 for something that apparently can be used for 5 long years is a steal and also it’s just so much less of a mess without a pad or a campan. i was feared to use this initially but then once used it is very very comfortable and i have forget my periods. definitely all women deserve this comfortness. why r we always thinking about position of a pad time feeling witness discomfort while walking standing and sleeping. we can he very normal while using this. it may seem a little expensive but it is worth every rule. it is the best you will get. i like this product. he product really good had. female i problem se 100 multi the product quality is really good the texture is soft which makes it easy to use and makes you feel comfortable. would definitely recommend twitching to a menstrual cup i never expected it to be as it is in picture if you thinking it will not be exact like picture then u are wrong it is of good quality and value for money to for it good and flexible. easy to fold and comfortable to use. twitching to a menstrual cup is a total game changes no chaffing no witness feeling i love this

is more of my problem than it was because of the cup. i had a low flow more like only sporting so i had no publication hence the struggle. i gave up. when on my third day i gave it a try as i had a medium heavy flow. i sat on my toilet and i tried pushing it and it went in with ease. yes i felt some pain but bearable. had to feel it around a bit to check if it opened and it did. of not panic when you do do not worry take a breathe. it will be alright. okay so i felt nothing while it was in. to leakage. i was so happy during the whole time until the removing part came into the picture.nnot took me a max of 7 15 mind thank god it was not longer i made sure i didn t panic at any moment. even when i was on the verge of breaking out i relaxed took a deep breath and tried again with great determination pulled it out successfully. i sat on the toilet i pushed down the muscles like popping and had to dig around a bit to grab the stem. when after struggling i pushed the stem out i used both my hands the moment i felt the stem out a bit. i used my left hand for holding and the right for pitching the cup and pulling it out. i had a sore vagina for a couple of hours. i will definitely use this cup.nonly one desert is the length of stem i prefer it being a longer one. it would have only taken me a maximum of 1 2 mind for pulling it out if it had a longer stem. i hope the manufacturer of this cup produce these cups with a longer stem.nvery using the cup when you are home and nowhere to go.nnbeginners or first time users try getting a cup that has a longer stem. you can cut it off if you have a low croix. but to be on the safer and easy side go for a cup with a longer stem. menstrual cup is a game changes for all women .no am 35 i have started using it now and think about all the past years which could have been way easier if i had started using this .of you can master the technique half of your cringe will settle .nno for it without any second thoughts . i ve heard about menstrual cup in social media .and i ve researches on many video of qualified doctors gynecologists .and i came to know that if i use this then it will surely be a life changes.to with excitement i bought a menstrual cup of a particular brand and tried.but it was not meant for me as it causes pain after insertion and there was leakage .i could feel it inside .i was very disappointed .then i researches how it works . and i came to know that the problem was size .i ordered small size .and then i ordered see safe extra small even though i am 19 years old. i ve tried it out . its result came out amazingly.it was easy to insert as compared to previous one. i can t even feel it inside. .i ve seen in many veins that a pop sound will be heard but for me it was a feeling of sudden crawl painless .thanks to see safe for this extra small one . i ve uses in unto my 6 cycle of menstruationno girls .go for it :two hearts: i have been skeptically to use this cup asthe thought was scar. something that is inside you which collects your blood. :face screaming in fear:no did my research and consulted doctor to be sure. i was tired of using pad and wanted to switch to some better alternative. weapon was never a option due to various cases i read online. hence i was left with 3 option. reusable pads period party and menstrual cup. same to know about menstrual disc but that was still not a option for me. i ordered the cup and it arrived few days before my periods start. i saw in some online video where they asked to practice before the period. i tried but was practically failed. i thought will never be able to use it. n stopped trying out. but on the day of my periods i thought let s give it a try. blood acts as lubricant in this case and it s easier to glide the cup in. it was super smooth process and didn t face any difficulty. it did leak a bit but thankful i used a pad for safety. but as you use it you don t leak tall . his is such a life changesncoming to presage menstrual cup this is my first cup. it s soft and medical grade which makes it easy to handle clean and sterilise. it comes in good packing and a storage pouch. it s a good deal i bought other bands before this in 500 range. most of them had the same problem. they worked 1 2 times and then did not open up after insertion. the soft material is not very good or elastic to pop open inside the vagina it remained curved in c shape. hence i used only expensive cups in k range of good quality. but then i tried presage. i was scared that as this is unfordable it might have same issue of not opening inside. but i am writing this after 3 periods of use. and this has the capacity to open inside the body. it is soft but not cheap it pips open after trying different moves. an go for presage cups in unfordable range. of you are looking for a comfortable menstrual cup then this one suits you the best. using this for above year already. very one should use menstrual cup. it makes life very useful. it is easy to clean also and manage experience sustainable periods with utmost comfort must buy producteasy to useno leakage i ve thought of making the switch for over a year now and i m so glad i did the sustainability angle is incredible but i want to focus on how wonderful this product is. it s not hard to use at all yes it s confusing the first time but a breeze once you get it. i chose see safe over others because it s made in india and offers the of size. once i was able to place it correctly i couldn t even feel that there was this large thing sitting inside my body. the cup has made my periods a care free experience. head on for a detailed personal narration but in short go for it nof you re scared that it won t work out losing 250 bucks is definitely worth attempting possibly the biggest change in your life.nnon my conversations with other cup users picking the right size is the trickles part of the job. i chose of even though i m 18 because of limited sexual activity and a lighter flow and it turned out to be the correct size. i ve only ever used pads so the thought of inserting and removing a cup twice a day was just mortifying. i didn t place it deep enough in the first try; a third of it was outside my vagina and that was painful so i pushed it further gently. it slipped right in unfolded and sat comfortably inside the vaginal canal. it was spoke how such a large thing was between my legs and i just couldn t feel it. removing it was thicker. you can t just bank it out because it s stuck via vacuum. to be honest i got a bit scared because it wasn t coming out by pulling the stick. i calmed myself reached in a little deeper pinched the bottom and rotated the cup and out it came smoothly didn t feel a thing.nsterilising and washing between uses is not a big deal.the cup experience is so dramatically different from pads that it takes a cycle for your brain to tune into this technology. it s not rocket science just follow the instructions be calm and you ll be alright : buying this item by far has been d best decision of my life. part from the comfort n freedom this product gives will review more in specific about see safe cup here.the small/medium size is quite comfortable. either too large nor too small just perfect. material is sturdy enough to stay put n soft enough to fold and insert. it took me just 1 2 trials the first time i tried it on. the various fold style are clearly depicted in the manual provided. for me the punch down fold worked the best. the stem size is comfortable enough to stay inside and doesn t spoke out or show. after insertion the best way to check is to give a gentle pull at the stem to check if the suction vacuum has formed. of it doesn come out you are free for the next couple of hours depending on your flow while taking it off one needs to put slight pressure as if trying to see to get hold of the stem properly and then carefully remove vacuum n pull it out.the pouch provided with d cup is of pure cotton as new it leaves a lot of lint on d cup which doesn t go away by simple washing. preferably if the pouch is also washed ones thoroughly n dried before use it may not cause the same issue haven t tried but plan to before my next cycle as the cup will as it is have to be sterilised before next use overall very happy with d product.his is probably d only product i have ever bought for which i m willing to give a star rating against the max 5 allowed totally loved it after using it i never feel like having periods quite painful while come out but end of the day it s totally worth buying.nut ordered medium size i received small size and there is no return policy :confused face: of you of a first time user read of nalright so i read a lot of positive reviews and a few dreadful ones and at the end i decided to give it a try.nno the thing is i am 25 years old and i am a virgin and i have never used tampons meaning my vaginal canal is on the tighter side.nno yesterday when my cup arrived i washed it with soap and water and tried inserting it. i knew the c fold would not work for me so i did a punchdown fold and tried to insert it. when the cup was about 2 cms in the rest was still in my hand it started hurting. i had read in a lot of instruction manual and medical blows that if it hurts stop relax and try again later. to i gave it up for the time.ntoday i tried again in the shower this time inserting a finger first to feel out the croix so i could figure out how deep inside it needs to go. again punchdown fold insert and then it started hurting. i started to feel that maybe i should get a smaller cup.nnon all honesty i was afraid that i would hurt myself if the cup popped one,,0.14766710724693918,0.171,0.059,0.769,1.0

and a sidelong sanitary pad user. but i hate using pads because my skin is extremely sensitive and i always end up with rashes at the end of my rd day of a 6 day long cycle. which is as horrible as it sounds. i have tried dozens of different pads of different companies and nothing works. and on top of that i have very minimal period etiquette. which is to say i have none. to even 10 years since my first cycle i still end up staining my clothes.nno ve been trying to convince my mon to allow me to use a menstrual cup for years since i first saw the first soon up advertisement in 2015 and its only now that she s finally allowed me. to mind you i was quite determined to get it to work.nformed with the knowledge of hundreds of articles about what to do and what not to do i go into the mushroom on my first day of bleeding.nand.nno won t lie. it wasn t easy. i was in the bathroom for 45 minutes hot shower running to calm myself and another attempt just piling upon the previous attempts.nno tries.nthe first one i tried with a c fold but it was too big for my vaginal opening and the second attempt was made with a 7 fold whose tip made it inside before i got too uncomfortable and pulled out. the third attempt was with a punch down fold which was just the ideal size but again my opening was too small. by the fourth time my muscles had clamped up and nothing was going inside. th try was a throw away before i was giving up for the day. to i stop. stand under the shower and somehow i ve decided that tomorrow just sounds like a good idea. it would be my second day and that means more blood and more publication and an easier time to get it inside. the th try was just another attempt because my muscles had relaxed and i decided to surprise my vagina. and it kind of worked. i read an article where they said to push the cup towards your back and not up so the th try was supposed to be just another try that worked the cup was in nthe next 7 hours were heavenly. i constantly checked on myself to see if i was leaking or not because i have just never felt like this on my periods. over. before. but i did not. weak that is.nno now it was 7 hours past and i have to remove it and empty it. i did what the pamphlet of the cup told me to do push with my muscles and grab hold of the bottom of the cup and pinch it to pull out. did it work well no. the pitching worked in the most vague definition of working. it released a miniscule amount of pressure but the suction still existed. by the time i d pulled about a third of it out my vagina hated me and the suction felt like i was going to die. but the key is to not panic. i shoved two fingers inside and just pressed the body of the cup and with a hiss the suction died and the cup was out i was having a major utf moment but i did wash up and try to push the cup back in. and it did go inside in the very first attempt now that i had that technique down pat. but i could feel the cup inside me. clearly i had bruised my inner walls with my horrendous removal technique.nno i do what all women in such a situation does i went to rmenstrualcup.nthere i was told by a fellow citizen that a certain but in hotdog method should work. of i knew who that person was i d send them flowers because work it did by second attempt happened within seconds i pushed with my vaginal muscles until the stem was out and then relaxed and wriggled my middle fingers in along the walls of the cup pressing them towards its center. the moment i reached the rim of the cup i just pushed it inside itself and voila the suction is gone and then you just push with your muscles and the cup doth escape the cave nno m on my th day of the first cycle as of writing this review and the last three days have been the best periods of my life. i m officially converted and am never going back to sanitary pads. over.nnedit: it is my second cycle and the cup is being very stubborn. it refuses to open easily inside me and so i ve leaned. i will have to see if this is something that persists. also i m beginning to find the bottom design of the cup incredibly annoying as the little round of the stem is not as spherical as advertised instead is a hollow bowl shape that keeps on pitching me as my croix has dropped a few millimetres and is incredibly uncomfortable. the design team should take a look at that because i don t think sacrificing the comfort of the customer in lieu of cutting costs at the production is a smart idea. very good product the one who has heavy flow should definitely try. is i am 17 years old girl. and never ever had any sex or physical activities i was too scared to try this product but after watching several youtube video i finally decided to purchase a menstrual cup. when came the task to choose which menstrual cup should i use so that it fits me right. i watched a video of see safe menstrual up and saw that extra small is also available in it and it is specially made for teenager under 18 years of age. i was happy that finally i found a cup which is of my type. but still i was a little confused that i am 17 and after a few months i ll be 18 and then i ll have to use the small one so i searched literally everywhere that which size should i choose and finally i got to the see safe main web site and there was a feature to chat with one of their executive. to i consulted to them and they suggested me to use the extra small one. to i ordered this product. and guess what i received it on the second day of my period that is today. i used it in morning and here i m writing the review. i was getting into the bathroom for bath and suddenly the delivery boy came and i rushed to pick my order. i was happy that moment. i unvexed the cup and was surprised by seeing the size. i thought that it would be a little bigger than what i received and i got happy after seeing that the size is even smaller than what i imagined. when i took bath. after that i boiled my cup for 3 minutes and starting to out it in. i tried the punchdown fold and it didn t entered my vagina. when i tried the labia fold it was too tough to hold it in that fold. when i tried the c fold and entered it and successfully it entered but after that it was not opened and i couldn t put my two fingers inside as my hole is small. i took it out and once again tried the punchdown fold and this time it tried it forceful from the base to enter my vagina and it entered in 1 or 2 minutes and i pushed it inside and it went up to the croix. when i got out of the bathroom. it was painful inside and as i always watched the youtube and they always said it wouldn t feel anything after applying it but i was feeling pain and continuously i was feeling that something is inside me and i thought it is not opened properly that why it s hurting inside and stepped in the bathroom and tried pulling it out but as i was pulling the stem of it it was not coming down because it was already opened properly and it had the suction that was not allowing it to come down. i tried it very roughly and then thought if i ll do it continuously and pull it roughly like this i would break the stem may be so i relaxed myself and used my abdominal muscle to push it down as we do while popping and seeing and it easily went down i hold it from the base and pulled it out. after that i cleaned the cup and inserted it again but then also i was feeling pain and couldn t put it inside after trying hard for 10 minutes i decided to give on it up but then i thought one more time and tried it and it entered thankful. after that i have not taken it out yet and it is already 7 hours i ll take it out after 11 hours and will see what happens. i m still happy that i least tried to use it and successfully used it in very first time. i ve also used a pantyliner just to be a little sure of any leakage. it has not leaned till now. to i think it is a great product to have. and the pain i felt was because of my muscles down there because i ve never used anything inside and never had any sex in life so my muscles are really tight and that s why it am feeling pain but i think i will get used to it in some days. and the fact that i used it successfully in very first time is enough for me. to girls what are you thinking of order it fearlessly but first check your size and consult it to the customer care service of that cup. of you re a teenager like me u can definitely use see safe for sure. you ll never regret it. and thank me later. of this review helped you please like it. it is one of the contest cups i have used. it is very comfortable and easy to use. after a certain while you forget that it exists and also you forget about all the uncomfortable situations faced earlier with pads and other stuff. definitely recommended u now but ajeeb lata had is to use anna but pain full had .ye mere experience had been ages to is nasi anna chaise.and hum issue over flow k time use nasi war sake .but bald full sonata had and leakage hi one lata had .our body k and onset anna .but pushkin had our final hi but pushkin had .its a very pain full product .i can suggest you eyes .plan not by it:pleading face: i got this product yesterday and it was my first day of periods. was sacred to try it on but trust me guns this has changed my life it is a must try on productno easy to use itvery girl should try thismoved it this is going to be a long review and it s especially for girls like me who are teenager but are scared to even put a finger down in your vagina. first things first the product is really nice i m 18 years old so i bought the extra short one but after using it i realised my croix is pretty high but still if you re pondering over whether or not to buy this just go for it.now the next thing if you re scared to use it but you do want to change from sanitary pads/tampons to menstrual cups then let me tell you it s not going to be easy. especially if this is the first time you re going to use it. it took me a like 2 hours and 3 trials to get it successfully inside my vagina. once you put it inside you won t feel anything maybe a little bit uncomfortable for a few minutes but then you won t even realise you ve something sitting inside your vagina. it s super comfortable. so just go for it you won t regret.nor the procedure to put it inside you should know the punch down fold c fold felt a lot scar for me to use for the first time so i really recommend punch down fold . met in a comfortable position squat down and take deep breath to relax yourself. don t tense your muscles otherwise it s going to be really tough to get it inside. use the small diameter of punch down fold of the cup to slowly get it inside and it may hurt a little bit so before doing that try inserting a finger. i tried with my pink finger so you can do that too. when with your dominant hand insert it inside until the folded portion of the cup is inside and then slowly get it more inside. the stem of the cup must be inside your vagina properly too.of you ve a short croix then i d recommend you buy a cup of your size or either trim the stem out. when you ll probably hear a pop sound of the cup opening up or maybe not because i didn t hear it th . to check if the cup has created the required suction insert a finger and try to pull the stem really gently don t pull it too hard if you can t move the cup then voila the suction is created and you re ready for the day but for safety measures if you re using it for first time you should probably still keep sanitary pads with you.the next problem will be creating the suction my cup just wouldn t open up after getting inside. in this case just try changing portions or maybe try changing the fold you re using for your cup. for the first day i just gave up because it just didn t open but the next day it finally did. to don t give up it will work out for you. i was really scared of using it too but here i am after using it a single time and it was a good experience apart from all the failures and stress i put my body through :skull: next problem which might arise is removal of the cup you may find that cup has gone too high which happened with me and i creaked out . first things first don t freak out. it s still there just try inserting a finger and look for the stem. of you found the stem then slowly go up with that index finger and find the top of the cup and try to push on one side of the cup to break the suction. once you ve done it with that single finger try to wriggle the cup down slowly trust me it worked for me. must don t remove your finger from the top of the cup keep pressing the cup to break the suction and gently bring it down. that s what i did because the idea of inserting a thumb and index finger inside was too much for me.no hope this helped any one of you and i hope you don t have too much trouble with using it letter than many other bands. it fits so well that some times you don’t even feel that u have used something there. value for money. moved this product easy to use to for it good product it s good but sometimes vacuum it creates is too much. you are unable to take out the cup also stem is small.need improvement i m writing this review after using a medium size cup for 8 months. the product worked fine until today when the tip of the bottom of the cup broke off while trying to remove it from my vagina. the cup was meant to last for more than a couple years as the co. claims but now it needs to be discarded. wouldn t recommend see safe but would definitely recommend using menstrual cups. his is a super long review but might be helpful for a : after reading up and watching a ton on video and giving a lot of thought about twitching to a menstrual cup i ordered the see safe menstrual up small from here.after receiving the package whose outer cardboard box was torn and damaged please take notes amazon i went forward to examine the cup which was in a sealed packet inside the spade bag. the cup thankful was completely damaged.next i went forward to try the cup once i was still few days away from my periods . i opened the sealed package sterilised the cup as mentioned in the manual and then went ahead to try it in.honestly it was kind of a task. it at least took me 5 10 minutes to get myself to make the correct folds i tried the c fold and the lunch down fold . anyway somehow i then went ahead to insert it inside it took some effort there too of course but i was able to do it after few tries. still however i wasn’t sure if the cup had opened inside no apparent pop sound which i later read doesn’t always happen also it felt it being a bit weird in my vagina. i’d read it should feel like there’s nothing at all inside your vagina but it definitely felt like something. i watched few more video related to it and then went ahead to try it again. his time i realised the cup had opened not because i heard the pop sound but because i could feel the suction/vacuum when i tried moving the cup once it was inside this is the most accurate measure to make sure the cup has opened inside but again the cup still felt a little weird when i sat stood up or walked. i thought maybe this is how it is and let it be.last forward the day i got my periods i again sterilised the cup never skin this before the start of your cycle . i again went ahead to try the lunch down fold and oh with clean hands mind you always always wash your hands super clean before you either put it in or take it out. anyway so i then put it inside my vagina this time somehow it was easier it definitely took less time and effort. i then tried moving it once it was properly inside it didn’t move meaning the vacuum had been created and hence it was opened. all good. now the most surprising and ironic thing that happened here was this time the cup felt super comfortable inside like i had read everywhere. it was exactly like there wasn’t anything at all inside. now i don’t know why it was not the same the first day i tried it. now for the taking it out part that was definitely easier. i sat on the toilet and using my thumb and index finger i pinched the part just above the stalk of the cup to release the vacuum and slowly pulled it down and out. the fact that you’re sitting on the toilet helps so that even if the blood pills while you’re taking the cup out you don’t really make a mess.nor the next 3 days till the end of my cycle i used it of i took it out to clean after every 6 8 hours super comfortably.no’m so so glad i took the plunge and switched to something sustainable and co friendly and honestly ₹499 for something that apparently can be used for 5 long years is a steal and also it’s just so much less of a mess without a pad or a campan. i was feared to use this initially but then once used it is very very comfortable and i have forget my periods. definitely all women deserve this comfortness. why r we always thinking about position of a pad time feeling witness discomfort while walking standing and sleeping. we can he very normal while using this. it may seem a little expensive but it is worth every rule. it is the best you will get. i like this product. he product really good had. female i problem se 100 multi the product quality is really good the texture is soft which makes it easy to use and makes you feel comfortable. would definitely recommend twitching to a menstrual cup i never expected it to be as it is in picture if you thinking it will not be exact like picture then u are wrong it is of good quality and value for money to for it good and flexible. easy to fold and comfortable to use. twitching to a menstrual cup is a total game changes no chaffing no witness feeling i love this product.but choose your size accurately most 15 25 is age group can use s or m but post pregnancy may need a bigger size. i ve been using this cup for eyes. i started using it when i was 13.love this product that i recommend this one to all my friends and family members. the stem has a grip on it and a small ball like thing at the end which is both very helpful in the usage of the cup. i ve not seen any other bands that has

. but packing was worst. i am a first time user. i bought a of peesafe up i had a hard time getting it in on my first day it is more of my problem than it was because of the cup. i had a low flow more like only sporting so i had no publication hence the struggle. i gave up. when on my third day i gave it a try as i had a medium heavy flow. i sat on my toilet and i tried pushing it and it went in with ease. yes i felt some pain but bearable. had to feel it around a bit to check if it opened and it did. of not panic when you do do not worry take a breathe. it will be alright. okay so i felt nothing while it was in. to leakage. i was so happy during the whole time until the removing part came into the picture.nnot took me a max of 7 15 mind thank god it was not longer i made sure i didn t panic at any moment. even when i was on the verge of breaking out i relaxed took a deep breath and tried again with great determination pulled it out successfully. i sat on the toilet i pushed down the muscles like popping and had to dig around a bit to grab the stem. when after struggling i pushed the stem out i used both my hands the moment i felt the stem out a bit. i used my left hand for holding and the right for pitching the cup and pulling it out. i had a sore vagina for a couple of hours. i will definitely use this cup.nonly one desert is the length of stem i prefer it being a longer one. it would have only taken me a maximum of 1 2 mind for pulling it out if it had a longer stem. i hope the manufacturer of this cup produce these cups with a longer stem.nvery using the cup when you are home and nowhere to go.nnbeginners or first time users try getting a cup that has a longer stem. you can cut it off if you have a low croix. but to be on the safer and easy side go for a cup with a longer stem. menstrual cup is a game changes for all women .no am 35 i have started using it now and think about all the past years which could have been way easier if i had started using this .of you can master the technique half of your cringe will settle .nno for it without any second thoughts . i ve heard about menstrual cup in social media .and i ve researches on many video of qualified doctors gynecologists .and i came to know that if i use this then it will surely be a life changes.to with excitement i bought a menstrual cup of a particular brand and tried.but it was not meant for me as it causes pain after insertion and there was leakage .i could feel it inside .i was very disappointed .then i researches how it works . and i came to know that the problem was size .i ordered small size .and then i ordered see safe extra small even though i am 19 years old. i ve tried it out . its result came out amazingly.it was easy to insert as compared to previous one. i can t even feel it inside. .i ve seen in many veins that a pop sound will be heard but for me it was a feeling of sudden crawl painless .thanks to see safe for this extra small one . i ve uses in unto my 6 cycle of menstruationno girls .go for it :two hearts: i have been skeptically to use this cup asthe thought was scar. something that is inside you which collects your blood. :face screaming in fear:no did my research and consulted doctor to be sure. i was tired of using pad and wanted to switch to some better alternative. weapon was never a option due to various cases i read online. hence i was left with 3 option. reusable pads period party and menstrual cup. same to know about menstrual disc but that was still not a option for me. i ordered the cup and it arrived few days before my periods start. i saw in some online video where they asked to practice before the period. i tried but was practically failed. i thought will never be able to use it. n stopped trying out. but on the day of my periods i thought let s give it a try. blood acts as lubricant in this case and it s easier to glide the cup in. it was super smooth process and didn t face any difficulty. it did leak a bit but thankful i used a pad for safety. but as you use it you don t leak tall . his is such a life changesncoming to presage menstrual cup this is my first cup. it s soft and medical grade which makes it easy to handle clean and sterilise. it comes in good packing and a storage pouch. it s a good deal i bought other bands before this in 500 range. most of them had the same problem. they worked 1 2 times and then did not open up after insertion. the soft material is not very good or elastic to pop open inside the vagina it remained curved in c shape. hence i used only expensive cups in k range of good quality. but then i tried presage. i was scared that as this is unfordable it might have same issue of not opening inside. but i am writing this after 3 periods of use. and this has the capacity to open inside the body. it is soft but not cheap it pips open after trying different moves. an go for presage cups in unfordable range. of you are looking for a comfortable menstrual cup then this one suits you the best. using this for above year already. very one should use menstrual cup. it makes life very useful. it is easy to clean also and manage experience sustainable periods with utmost comfort must buy producteasy to useno leakage i ve thought of making the switch for over a year now and i m so glad i did the sustainability angle is incredible but i want to focus on how wonderful this product is. it s not hard to use at all yes it s confusing the first time but a breeze once you get it. i chose see safe over others because it s made in india and offers the of size. once i was able to place it correctly i couldn t even feel that there was this large thing sitting inside my body. the cup has made my periods a care free experience. head on for a detailed personal narration but in short go for it nof you re scared that it won t work out losing 250 bucks is definitely worth attempting possibly the biggest change in your life.nnon my conversations with other cup users picking the right size is the trickles part of the job. i chose of even though i m 18 because of limited sexual activity and a lighter flow and it turned out to be the correct size. i ve only ever used pads so the thought of inserting and removing a cup twice a day was just mortifying. i didn t place it deep enough in the first try; a third of it was outside my vagina and that was painful so i pushed it further gently. it slipped right in unfolded and sat comfortably inside the vaginal canal. it was spoke how such a large thing was between my legs and i just couldn t feel it. removing it was thicker. you can t just bank it out because it s stuck via vacuum. to be honest i got a bit scared because it wasn t coming out by pulling the stick. i calmed myself reached in a little deeper pinched the bottom and rotated the cup and out it came smoothly didn t feel a thing.nsterilising and washing between uses is not a big deal.the cup experience is so dramatically different from pads that it takes a cycle for your brain to tune into this technology. it s not rocket science just follow the instructions be calm and you ll be alright : buying this item by far has been d best decision of my life. part from the comfort n freedom this product gives will review more in specific about see safe cup here.the small/medium size is quite comfortable. either too large nor too small just perfect. material is sturdy enough to stay put n soft enough to fold and insert. it took me just 1 2 trials the first time i tried it on. the various fold style are clearly depicted in the manual provided. for me the punch down fold worked the best. the stem size is comfortable enough to stay inside and doesn t spoke out or show. after insertion the best way to check is to give a gentle pull at the stem to check if the suction vacuum has formed. of it doesn come out you are free for the next couple of hours depending on your flow while taking it off one needs to put slight pressure as if trying to see to get hold of the stem properly and then carefully remove vacuum n pull it out.the pouch provided with d cup is of pure cotton as new it leaves a lot of lint on d cup which doesn t go away by simple washing. preferably if the pouch is also washed ones thoroughly n dried before use it may not cause the same issue haven t tried but plan to before my next cycle as the cup will as it is have to be sterilised before next use overall very happy with d product.his is probably d only product i have ever bought for which i m willing to give a star rating against the max 5 allowed totally loved it after using it i never feel like having periods quite painful while come out but end of the day it s totally worth buying.nut ordered medium size i received small size and there is no return policy :confused face: of you of a first time user read of nalright so i read a lot of positive reviews and a few dreadful ones and at the end i decided to give it a try.nno the thing is i am 25 years old and i am a virgin and i have never used tampons meaning my vaginal canal is on the tighter side.nno yesterday when my cup arrived i washed it with soap and water and tried inserting it. i knew the c fold would not work for me so i did a punchdown fold and tried to insert it. when the cup was about 2 cms in the rest was still in my hand it started hurting. i had read in a lot of instruction manual and medical blows that if it hurts stop relax and try again later. to i gave it up for the time.ntoday i tried again in the shower this time inserting a finger first to feel out the croix so i could figure out how deep inside it needs to go. again punchdown fold insert and then it started hurting. i started to feel that maybe i should get a smaller cup.nnon all honesty i was afraid that i would hurt myself if the cup popped one,,0.14766710724693918,0.171,0.059,0.769,1.0

the same.nnut it did not the first and best experience with this product.no irritationno leakagenot at all uncomfortablenan swim sleep do anything with the help of this.definitely hands get little mess but its much better than our clothes getting mess.noverall extraordinary product. would love to have another 2 or 3 of this vice west i was so awakened whenever i see menstural cup in video but i always wanted to try one. to i got peesafe mental cup as my friend suggested me this brand. the moment i got this cup in my hand it s so tiny than what we see in video and it s super soft. insertion was a bit easy for me but i felt little difficult to take it out but was not very bad. i really enjoyed using cup for 2 days but was a bit conscious since it s my first usage and along with this i also used presage cloth pads as i totally wanted to avoid using other pads as the number of pads that i am using per cycle frightened me. i am definitely going to try mental cup in other cycle and will update review if i come across something. also used the steriliser and it was quiet easy to pour hot water in it and shake and refuse it. also got presage mental liquid to clean it. it s all worth it.only key to insert and take out is being very calm and trusting your body. enjoy the process and it s totally worth it : must buy for happy period useful product and very easy to carry must buy the size is not per description. to for the bigger one for medium flow as it is quite small. have been using since 7 months. it s very convenient. it doesn t feel like it s even inside me. for

the circus goes on until you have got it thoroughly right. of inserted wrongly then you have hell lot of trouble with all the blood spelling onto your clothes. his can be very frustration.nhis product is fairly good to use at home only. usually offices colleges and other public toilets don t have the facility to wash the cup outside the final. you can t remove the cup in the lavater and run to an outside sink wash it thoroughly and rush back to the lavater to insert again.nthe whole process of removal washing and re inserting is a time consuming process compared to the ease of sanitary napkins. of you are rushing into a meeting class kitchen or kiss this thing takes up your time.nof you think you are in a leak proof or care free situation think again :thinking face:. his product has no way of indicating that it is time to empty the cup. the only notice you get is stains nalso i dreaded the idea of constantly washing the blood stained cup with bare hands we have never done it before with sanitary napkins . it feels lucky:face vomiting:.nthe product not the brand of the product itself has to go through a transformation to be considered as an alternative fit to menstrual hygienic. vice product soft material:thumbs up medium light skin tone:. but it won t withstand for 8 10hrs as claimed. 30 35 women single never delivered a baby with heavy bleeding have to ch change/replace in 3 his. due to which i must/have to use pad also for safety.not st i purchased medium size which is actually waste now :person gesturing ok light skin tone::face with rolling eyes:. its my very first time using a menstrual cup and i chose this one co it says that its the contest cup ever but it is not; the rim and upper part if the cup is a bit hard.and it smells like later rubber however; the experience was very good i tried the cup before my period arrived 2 3 times to practice all the mechanism it wasn t easy at st time but it in went and time but nothing but half demand fold worked for me. when my period arrived i could easily use it but in still learning it will take time to use it with zero efforts. but;ones it is in it feels like nothing is there.and from the very first day i used it i did not leak at all not a single spot i never felt so comfortable on my periods. i am happy with the decision of twitching to menstrual cup. :grinning face with smiling eyes:now i am recommending it to every woman around me:slightly smiling face: my tip to begging is to practice until u get it right when or not on your period so u could use it without much efforts while your period. trust me you ll never want to go back to pads again :smiling face::smiling face:its a revolution for all the ladies i love other caries products. therefore bought this one when i wanted to make the switch. were’s my review:nlikes:nextremely good for first time users who are scared of inserting something into their vagina. the cup is extremely soft and can be folded with almost zero effortneasy extraction owing to it’s softness and a long tail/ stemnsize is relatively smaller than other bands and therefore the feeling of “ nothing “ is quite highnnone:nnot much softness is not apt for a good seal . it pills if you pinch the cup while removingnthe stem is too long for those who are used to cups or even tampons i being the latter . it kind sticks outnit smaller than what you would expect from a medium size cupnwas leakage issuesnoverall a great one for the first time users of insertion method period product. in my opinion it is even less invasion than a campan and easy to use. it loses it’s elasticity after a few use and refuses to seal well. the stem would require trimming for women with low or medium croix height. but it is a great product if you have never used anything other than pads and want to learn/ get used to how cups work its cool.i liked it.up i do recommend this cup to all first time users. but it completely depends on your use if you d find it comfortable or not.nlips:n compulsorily sanitize the cup first using normal soap or intimate wash and then put it in boiling water water for 2 minutes.n deep your nails clean and preferably trimmed least while using it for the first time. very important n of you experience any difficulty while placing the cup for the first 2 3 attempts. take a break for 15 20 minutes and then try again.n cry to find a clear looking cup as you can t be completely assured about the eyes that have been used with the silicon.n you might find cheaper cups but i would recommend to buy a mid ranged one for a good first time experience.n buying cheaper ones can lead to leads or discomfort making the overall experience not so good and might get you away from using menstrual cups again.n his cup comes with a pouch which is a 1 but doesn t have a container along. of possible store it in a container to avoid any damages to the cup.nn based on the experiences of my known people the size recommendations can be:n•early teenager: smalln•adult teenager:n sexually active / overnight : mediumn sexually inactive / underweight : smalln•women in 20 s not given birth vaginal n any body size : mediumnnon: needs a more sturdy and travel friendly packing/container ladies go for it it is used for life save now.very easy to use and clean yes indeed menstrual cups are boon to us women. you are odorless during your period. you can roam like a free bird. you won t feel that you are on your period. the thing here is the insertion and taking out process. you can t insert it in one go. i as a beginner tried so many times and finally made it. now inserting it is not a tension for me. now how to take it out well this is painful. the pressure created inside will not let it out. and it unfold while taking it out and it hurts. i still am struggling how to remove it painlessly. and regarding using sanitary pads you have to use it when you are on your rd day of period. cups are good for heavy flow days but when it is nearer to its end pads are must. i also don t think it is a good replacement of pads as it is not easy use it takes time. love this product so much fun of my friend recommend this and it s such a good product and just loving it i love my periods no its so free in periods i can even swim i can anything in my periods no i don t have to think about stain on my clothes anything like that i love it i have been using menstrual cups for 7 years. such a waste product which i bought in these years. not sturdy it s so flexible so it don t get open . quality is good just the size is small and is more suitable for 24 years and below girls having low to medium flow. not recommended for heavy flow.also it creates a strong vacuum which sometimes is difficult to break and pull out.overall its comfortable. take your time to figure out a comfortable fold and insert it similarly to a campan .not wouldn’t have to face any leakage if you make sure that the cup has full opened up .no slight pinch at the bottom with a swift motion would be the easiest and quickest way of removal .no what makes you feel the most comfortable . most of all relax .nnon certain rare occasions wherein i kept the cup longer than i intended to i have experienced sporting due to heavy flow this doesn’t have to be a necessary one but party liners always come in help.letter safe than sorry.noverall all about the productn very neat packing.n comes in a cut little bag .n sturdy .n well defined instructions. i believe twitching from pads to mental cup has been a great decision. it worked out great for me. it s been around 9 months and now i cannot think about going back to pads.nwhy should you buy itn it s extremely comfortablen it s 100 safen no leadsn no pad rashes or itchingn easy to find the right sizen extremely unfordablen and u get a cut pouch toonone tip: make sure u sanitize it well before and after every use and always use clean hands.nnon t stress much it might look scar but once you start using cups there no going back. you ll love it too nn~ from a 15yr old i ve been using cups for quite some time and i m familiar with it but this one doesn t behave nicely sometimes it doesn t open leads most of the time and also the stem jokes a lot. west option for women . wonderful experience .pad free nights. wash free periods i m an u 18 user so i bought this product as it looked like the best in the market and once it arrived the packing was also very adorable. when came the hard part to insert it i broke a sweat trying to insert this cup but it just did not go in i have tried this for 2 cycle but it still has not gone in no plan to buy another one just to see if the problem was with this cup and my body or just my body i also very well understand that some cups are just not meant for some bodies hence i m willing to try.nether than that the cup is packed very well comes with a little bag and instructions sheet loved the aesthetic the steam steriliser does its job well. there s a measuring cup and a cloth provided. i just didn t like that the lid of the steriliser doesn t lock properly. have been using this for a while now. this is my first cup and let me tell you think no further just get it. no leads no infection no pads .never knew periods could be this fun.my life changed for good after started using this. very convenient while travelling too.loveeee it. product or very nice it over size of you’re new to the menstrual cup this is a great one to start with. most cups i’ve tried i’ve had a hard time to pulling it out but the end tail of the cups gives you a an edge to hold on to. it’s easy to clean unable and comfortable to wear. not good quality silicon is very hard . st time user .feeling better.hoping same in future it s like a plastic i don t feel silicon texture. vice product quality is nice . only the stem of cup is little bit hard otherwise product is really nice menstrual cup is the best experience one can have .no was very scared to use at the 1 time but the experience at the 1 time itself was so satisfying that i can t even describe in words .not s rash free the main reason i switched from pads to cup.everyone should try using it n i m sure you will experience it really good usually i am not review writer on any products but i ll rate 4.5 star for st use.after and n so on will see through itnot was quite tough for st insertion once it fit correctly inside then no need to worrynot won t allow for leakage until unless if it s properly fit inside vaginaholding of cup is different on their comfortable i liked the product as it is very hygienic because you will no more smell like hell in your periods no smell would come from you literally no smell insertion need technique that you will figure out in 1 use only as we got use to pad when we were new to it. i too got comfortable with cup and trust the product you will have no leakage in night day whatever you do as there was in pad definitely an innovation for female . mustard try and must have in your period vanity box. i recently made a sustainable switch from the old itchy sanitary pads to menstrual cups. being a first time user i was extremely scared and it took me a few months to convince myself but here i am wondering why i didn t make this switch earlier no did my fair bit of research on cups before deciding to buy the warmest m sized cup and it was the best decision not took me a few tries to well put it in but once you figure out what works best for you this cup works like a charm. to leads no staining and absolutely no discomfort. the cup is super soft and easy to insert. opens up pretty easily and its super easy too remove it as well. didn t need to cut the stem.ney friend who previously used cups from presage she said they were too tough switched to caries and she too loves how soft it is. easy to use . it s good also . after using this product in vagina no problem no rashes in this product specified know clergy not a problem it s good. actually after 1 year i am giving this product review i don t know how to give review also so now i came to know so right now i am giving this love you but product is become now old okay i will take one pick. many times i will give rating i don t know how to give review also only so long time anyway the product thank you take sure to take the right size cup we will only get to know if we use it once boy as the guideline mentioned am supposed to take large as i had a vaginal delivery but for me it’s too large and not at all comfortable as i could sense little discomfort and have purchased medium one which fits properly and it almost makes me feel that am not on my periods.north buying and must try. received the caries menstrual cup in the size small in a perfect condition. the cardboard comes with the cup a pouch and a detailed instruction leaflet.no ve been a cup vert for a while now and this brand looks promising hence went ahead and bought a small cup for light flow days. the cup is nearly 5 cm deep and has 4 holes punched towards the brim for suction break. the only concern i have is the stem being really long which might just spoke out and irritate. gros:not has a long stem so women with a tall croix can also go for this.the material is soft however the cup is quite firm. of you have a strong pelvis pelvic floor then this one is for you.not has good suction and feels absolutely comfortable after inserting.nnone:taking it out is tricky because of it s firm make however with little practice it gets easier.non heavy flow days there was very slight leakage. it could be that i couldn t get it right the first time.nnot s a wonderful product very comfortable and very unfordable too. it has no colour and no added perfume.nno made a switch to menstrual cups about a year ago and i ll never go back to using pads. of you d like to make a switch then please watch some youtube tutorials before purchasing a cup.good luck with lot of research got this cup.super comfortable after using for 2 3 times.nor first time users pus except initial leads this is because you may not be completely familiar with your anatomy. you can always wear a pad for safety.nut after using it for 2 cycle u become a pro in inserting and removing.non fact u can be aware if the cup is leaking may be due to improper insertion or the cup is not stationed completely . give it a try for 2 3 times until u become comfortable.worth it .wash free tension free nights colourless. i believe i found the best one. i have purchased the menstrual cups twice. but i felt the both of them were too hard to put it in. to matter you are a been or a lady who has the experience to deliver babies when you use a menstrual cup you have to practice it a couple of times. even though the item seems good it might feel painful. when i used this item for the first time i struggled with it and felt pain. after some time i am able to use it easily and i m feeling come as this item is very soft.non general we have to keep/maintain it cleaned and we should not continue to use it for more than 8 hours as per the instructions. he need to pay attention more rather than a pad. for a first time the idea of a menstrual cup scared me a lot but warmest definitely made life easier. not only did they respond to my queried on instagram and helped me pick the right size for me the overall experience of the product is beyond comparison.nmade with medially approved silicone the cup is my step forward to experience a sustainable period. once you fold and put it inside you do take a day to adjust to it. but then it is super easy to use and you need to simply take it out wash it and refuse afterwards again nnot also comes with a cut pouch for you to store it once you are done for the month ngreat quality and definitely value for money against all the money we spend on sanitary napkins nney pro tip: on’t be scared and try it writing this review from my husband s account as i had ordered from his prime account.not will take you 2 3 periods to learn the proper way to handle it. the size of the cup of perfect i found no issues with the length.no complaints about this product. i got this as it has no added color scent parades and it seemed like a genuine brand. give it a try nalso one you get used to using menstrual cup you will be grateful for using it and ask yourself why did you not take the leap before.imagine years of no pads during periods no rashes and freedom to swim exercise etc.very female should give a definite try a menstrual cup once in their life. his brand s cup is not leak proof and isn t soft. not at all recommended. i used this first time.its convenient to use but i feel a little bit discomfort as well.may be i used to this by cycle by cycle.nut the removal process is kind of mess so take your time to used to this menstrual cup i think this will become saviour for me and other girls also i was in search of a good menstrual cup since a long time now wanted to get rid of wearing pads. i came across this one. it first i was a bit sceptic but still bought it. is a st time user it felt little different for the st 2 days but later i got used to it. the holes below rim does the trick of creating vacuum the cup stays intact. to stains no discomfort. i used it at night too while sleeping so it was like 8 10 his probably still no stains. once you get hold to it it s pretty comfortable. i am glad i bought it. now no more sanitary waste. give it a try. on t get scared before using it give yourself some time to adjust to it. now in using strong cup s size so i ordered for my mon m size cup in caries after i notice it both same size and they mentioned in the box l size is for married and for who gave natural birth. i feel just to share my experience here. not complaining about anything :smiling face with smiling eyes: thanks vice product and very comfortable to use oh my god i m soon comfortable with caries. its so soft. easy to insert and remove. only issue i felt is that it is small in size. i was using care s sized sensual cup and ordered caries s m sized cup. it care s s is still bigger. to i have to clean it more frequent than i did it with care. to if u have heavy bleeding try l of caries.otherwise amazing quality. u can hardly feel it. thank you so much for this revolutionary product:smiling face with heart eyes: well i ordered this in small size but instead i got the medium one ink what s with the delivery. but the product is soft. the upper suction part is kind thick it was definitely hard to stuck it in and unfortunately due to that i want able to make any type of shapes for insertion. but give it a try:thumbs up medium light skin tone: his is great overall but i found it to be a bit harder than expected. to your research on whether you need a firm or softer cup. the suction was really strong which made it slightly harder to remove the first time. to if you re a beginner try finding a more flexible cup instead preferably with a ring instead of stem for removal. girls. all buy if you can use hard product. it s not soft at all. all don t use this . i am not a new user. am using cup from last 3 years. those who are using the cup for the first time. due to such a hard insertion and pulling out.you got the horrible experience. all use a soft cup . key girls let s get straight to the point. his product is an absolute masterpiece you can t doubt this as it s so comfortable and soft and glided with your body plus has no chemicals or eyes. i was scared about the size but everything went well i m so impressed with this product. by period ended without having even a single drop of blood stain on clothes. need to be cleaned after 8 9 he of usage and after insertion it doesn t even feel like you re even on your periods. west part is it s co friendly and easy on money. to buy this baby. excellent product every woman should start using. in beginning i was really scared and worried. by friends suggested me to buy the product and use. after i started using its very easy to use. one should be very relaxed while using this product if u r in hurry and if u don t insert properly it starts leaking. of u insert properly not even single drop of blood is seen. was be hygienic while using this. over all product is very soft and easy to use . top is hard and bottom of cup is very thin not properly fit and it leads to leaking lay videothe cup is in good quality but the very edge of the cup is too hard. it is difficult to use when the edges are too thick. was good fragrance. means menstrual cup and clears odour. compared to other cups somehow the fit of warmest’s cup is perfect. easily adjustable whereas i struggle with other brand pieces. probably it’s the perfect density/thickness of the cup that helps with the adjustment. i just feel it’s well need. its very comfortable to use but after many research i found that rarely any one get allergic with silicone products like 99 will comfortable in silicone use but 1 or people get allergic with silicone product am in that 1 :pleading face::crying face: so if you feel itching or pimples in vagina after some use of cup than stop using silicone made cups i am 25yr unmarried woman. i was using 1 cup for 3 month but after that it is unable to fit easily but this one is so good. his is getting inserted so easy and this is very soft in comparison to older one. i will suggest to buy this cup boy or it s softness and it s shape which makes it to open inside very easily. must try fantastic product.near ladies please try once i bet you love it.of you try once definitely you will say bye bye to sanitary pads napkins etc.nvery much comfortable.within 4 5 seconds you can wear.nut only thing that you should learn how to insert .their are many video in youtube just go through.that s all.nenjoy your period days without any irritation.his is 100 genuine feedback.nhappy periods. good for users its good but i think i would take more time to feel comfortable with these cups. very good product quality nice :thumbs up: west investment ever in the hygienic products. everything is really good but cup ka stem those bad had to uncomfortable lata had. i wish it could be smaller than its is now. take compare to other cups its much much better. for first time it feel little uncomfortable but from the day second of cycle itself just going with come level great. north buying. you can save a lot of money wasting on sanitary pads and minimizing social embarrassment due to need of changing pads. remember one thing before inserting on first day of period and after each cycle sterile the cup in boiling water for few minutes. met it dry n then use or store. his product is just dam product i will suggest for every woman. easy to use and no tension of leakage. but while sitting you feel it. but it will not irritate you. i like this product quality is very good packaging and the presentation was good. product is also comfortable.the instructions in it was really helpful. overall i m happy with the purchase :d it s not the same quality as it was a year back this is the second time i ordered the product which is very hard i didn t expect this type of quality in caries it got good market and immediately switched to provide a low quality like some other cheap companies please change the quality to as earlier before it went wrong not suitable for beginners. it is too firm and rim of cup is not smooth. its packing and everything has good quality but not at all comfortable with it. i have bought another cup because of it. and it is much better. it first i thought how can i use it what to do etc but after to use it becomes to easy to use and i like the product you should buy it its to good easy to use comfortable :smiling face with smiling eyes::smiling face with smiling eyes:i am very happy for using it and i had a pad free periods thank amazon i love the product i haven t tried any other product yet ink if it is like normal but you can feel this cup inside yourself and this kind hurts. it s not very easy to use initially have to keep trying to get the hang of it and the correct position. the stick is actually annoying it feels like it s hanging out. i had to cut it a bit to make it smaller. but surely there is no wet feeling and rush to change pads every now and then. it was my first period with a cup i guess i will get better with the insertion by the next. or i will test another brand. only thing is the mouth has little sharp edge there s no going back after using cups. start using cups girls sap without second thought. good for environment and for herself too so what else u need must go for it. i am not sure if i got an original one or just an old model because i got the product completely different from what is shown in the picture. in fact i only got a pouch to keep the cup and not the covered box which i saw many others got i ordered the size m. after using for a month and post washing and sterilizing it the colour changed from white to yellowish on t know how the quality of it is also i am changing it quite often as i am in my home. it feels like it is unable to hold much once office starts it will be difficult to re use outside. menstrual cups as a product takes time to re use and not very comfortable to change when you are

nasi hue use like medium size is best quality was ok i bought my fault soft up in the of but unfortunately i boiled it a bit too long almost burned down my house and it got damaged. i couldn t purchase another one and that was my perfect cup and after heavy research i couldn t find any cup in india that would be the equivalent. by search has ended the of cup perform and looks identical to the salt soft e on left salt on right down to the size and texture/firmness. the only added bonus is the intents to break the suction which are a genius addition that make it very easy for a newby to use i tested it out this cycle and the performance is great to leads you can keep it in for up to 10 12 hours depending on your flow and it is not too firm that it will bear down on your bladder i am already purchasing the small version of this for lighter days thanks of cup the cup size is good. but the rubber material is very hard n is painful to insert and remove. the product itself is great it s the regular size a bit thicker and bigger than other cups the small size ones so i don t recommend these for people that are buying a menstrual cup for the first time because i had great difficulty inserting it it was my first time using a cup . so i had to buy a smaller one before this one could fit me. but after that it s been working amazingly and there s no leads when i wake up my other cup tended to leak a little. not to mention the steriliser case easy to keep in a bag and doesn t require much water to sterilise it. waves water and time when you re rushing too. i liked the quality of the cup. it is soft but hard enough but the size of cup is small for heavy flow days. i will have huge range of bleeding on first two days of my periods on those days the come is getting overflow before the expected time like with in one hour itself before this i used later size cup of safecup brand but its not available now when comparing the size with that also this one is small. but overall it is good. had free period :grinning face:good quality the cup is a bit thick for people like me who are scared by the very thought of a menstrual cup but it s highly efficient trust me. it s tricky to insert for the first and second time but gets easier as you gain experience. there will be tiny leads if the cup is worn for too long like more than 4 hours. and there are sure leads when you feel like popping. but it s truly magical. period doesn t look like a period anymore a must buy for every woman. it was my first time using a menstrual cup and i thought it was normal for it to hurt a bit at the start but it didn t get better even after two months of use. i think the cause is the design of the tail of the cup which is rectangular instead of round. it keeps digging into some area down there everytime i insert it. i tried inserting it to go higher or lower but in the end the result was always the same. i tried cutting off the end and making it shorter and shorter but the pain was still there. i encourage the company to work on the design a bit so it can offer a better level of comfort. i do like the grooves at the bottom that make it easier to grip it and pull it out. i have been using this for a while now. his is the second brand i ve tried in the last few years. it s thicker than other cups and very very hard to get out. it also leads more. i would not recommend it. been using this for almost 6 months now or so. good product. peaks sometimes. i use party liners when my flow is heavy. good large size is too big and it’s not replaced it very thick compared to other all bands at first it was very comfortable to insert but after use of few times it’s ok. to leakage. his cup has better suction than other . that’s is really good. for me it best part is container box that comes with it . sterilise and store superb i am a former cup user and bought this as my second cup.by first cup was a soft one so i was looking for a firmer one. the main motive of mine while looking for a second cup was that it has to be firm so that it doesn t leak my and days of periods are usually heavy and as my st cup was soft it used to leak plus it was hard to open it up inside my vagina. but with this cup i had none of these issues.yes due to its firmness it s hard to get it inside so you can use a lubricant coronet oil and it opens up inside itself i did not have to do anything plus i had heavy flow and it did not leak .his cup has all the qualities i was looking for so i am proud of myself for choosing this cup after his of research and strolling through hundreds of cup available another reason i choose this cup was that it was made in india and many cups which were firm and popular were from china whose products are not trust worthy. i ll let you all know if i find any flaw of this cup in future hope this helps. it is very nice product. easily inserted. i also tried 2 3 bands menstrual cup. but it is best from among all of them. either it s the first times or not this cup is definitely better i bought this product 2 months back. his is worth buying for its thickness and comfort. i ordered a small size. but it s little smaller than my previous menstrual cup which was also an s size. the container is very useful as well. a very fabulous choice doesn t leak at all provides good suction totally comfortable easy to use and of the best part is

heart: i used this as my second menstrual cup and it’s quite sturdy and has a good suction once inserted properly. though can be used on days with very less flow. the suction is so intact that incise

great relief and pad free periods are best the removal of cup is hard as silicon is slippery making it difficult it is because of the design itself. the girl is bit higher from the stem. of there are aims around the joining part of stem and the cup the removal would be much easier. i ve been an aid user of menstrual cups for the past four years and i recently decided to try a new product on the market. unfortunately my experience with this new menstrual cup has left me quite disappointed.nfirst and foremost the flexibility of this cup is lacking. unlike my previous cup which easily adjusted to my body s movements this one feels rigid and uncomfortable. his lack of flexibility has made it challenging to achieve a comfortable fit which is crucial for a menstrual cup s effectiveness.nmoreover the process of inserting and removing this cup has prove to be far more difficult than with my previous one. it doesn t seem to have the same user friendly design that i ve come to rely on. his has led to some frustration and uncomfortable moments during my menstrual cycle.ndespite my years of experience with menstrual cups i ve encountered leakage issues with this product which is not something i ve had to deal with in the past. his unexpected inconvenience has made me question the reliability of this new cup.nnon conclusion my experience with this new menstrual cup has been far from positive. it lacks the flexibility and ease of use that i ve come to expect from such products and its performance has left me unsatisfied. is a long time user of menstrual cups i will be returning to my previous brand as it has consistently met my needs and provided a higher level of comfort and reliability. i am amazed i have tried 3 different bands and none have been this comfortable. his is easy to use and doesn t leave plus the pullout doesn t spoke. i don t even realise it s there and unlike before i have not had to use pads to catch the leak.,https://www.amazon.in/Ezcup-Reusable-Menstrual-Sterilising-Container/dp/B0BG2942G5/ref=sr_1_11?crid=1H94OLN6PX1I2&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.IBcLhChdzpTkrnQnb6fDzzUr3pFubXzT_zUq65uO37VLpCaDlg8051biiX70QMp5z2Q73dYEx6jA356rvitQJlgk8Q4cpo1Wry3JXZJpR7eT_7YqwEWQocaUpE6hZeWQu7Pl_mFZFs1BnS9HX2PKWnilLHWq1xlMov_5vNmSIe1TSHxgbVnEsXwgG1UpDsPynKeLGKTVYR5z9b5dxqw7wTuiCkcHW6jgLdV4Qg7Qer3AEeW_17aXn3MZ8bax1O_7R5eQPmMwYQ-beuO_Ur1NhGroKBuWEPDHxgZpzQd3378._Re01IMHO8B5dRHTSRO-6jt0qiQjFrG0heGsvacAqXI&dib_tag=se&keywords=women+menstrual+cups&qid=1722587880&sprefix=women+menstrual+cups%2Caps%2C251&sr=8-11,0.18169775158761964,0.243,0.068,0.689,1.0

his aah menstrual cup is nice. first i was using presage cup but due broke near stem so shifted to this ring cup. it s easy to pull out. i feel that ring a little uncomfortable but can be neglected. i felt the thickness of cup could be ll more thick and it feels thin to press. it s soft and easy to use. one can definitely try this cup. also it comes with small pouch to carry and super cut box packing. quality first time i m using this product it s awesome and i feared about using this product for the first time but really feel good and hygienic. the ring presses against the vaginal wall and makes it uncomfortable. i could especially feel it when i sat down. that being said the ring does make it very easy to find and remove so it is a good practice tool for first time users who are scared that they won’t be able to remove the cup. would definitely not use it in the long run though. i’ve started using the peesafe cup now and it’s way more comfortable. the stem doesn’t bother me and even if it does bother you it can be trimmed down. i would recommend this to all girls at first you need to practice to put it inside correctly once u know how to use it you will love this… please go ahead and start using it. i have been using many types of cups for several years and this is the worst product i have came across. not easy to use. painful. though they have mentioned the same materials used to for making cup but not easy to use. not suggesting this product to anyone. haste of money. of you have one of these you will save all your money spend on pads that is a lot his product is haste free convenient to refuse whenever you need to. it’s just a matter of getting used to menstrual cup is just the best option may be the only healthy option for your period. it s hygienic healthy skin friendly co friendly everything. his one from ah has a ring at the end of stem which makes it easy to handle especially while pulling out. to for it. good :thumbs up: i liked it i don t know why most of the reviews didn t mention this bit the ring is quite uncomfortable when inside and you could always feel it. its good while removing but otherwise its very much uncomfortable. i think i would prefer the stem more i ve been a cup user for 5 years and it s been amazing but also a struggle sometimes. i believe this medium sized cup fits me better than the iron cup i am used to. it is slightly smaller all capacity difference but i guess that helped in my case. the cup would pop open inside instantly which the iron cup sometimes wouldn t and the ring at the end is obviously helpful while pulling out. quality up to mark. his might be my new go to cup i am a first time user.first i bought s size in presage but as a normal delivery mon it doesn t suit me and the pull out is very tough and i bought l size in presage but that was too large and i couldn t able to insert it. during next cycle i bought this ah brand m size.it fits me so well and the pulling out option they gave in this brand is awesome.i am so happy with the product and as a first time user after two trials i got successful in the third one.thankyou for this brand:thumbs up:. it is really comfortable and easy to use i put off using cups for a long time cut i was afraid but the circle at the end made it so much easier for me. it s really amazing experience.twitching from pads to cup was transition for me.no was so scared to do.i was having rashes every time when using pads though tried for many option.but twitching to cup was a bigger relief. one of my friend recommended for it think to give a try.no had literally practiced for it when was not on period for proper insertion and removal .and it worked for me like magic. using from last 8 months with no problem at all.not s really life save when you plan for waterpark beach visits you or anything you worried for not to go.nous environment friendly and economic .choose for its loop shape at bottom and it helps a lotttt.using medium size currently and ordering l for first 2 days.now i even don t remember i am having periods.a big relief :grinning face with sweat: 32f not given birthalways wear a pad because there are chances of few drops leaking.have your finger nails clipped otherwise they can scratch the inner walls of your v.ney logic is to push the cup inside the narrow opening/barrier that you can feel inside your vagina. of you have placed your cup on inside it will work properly. on’t worry while pushing the cup inside your v as it will not get lost. i push the cup as inside as possible with my index finger because that really works for me.of the cup is not inserted properly you will be uncomfortable and you will be able to feel it.not will leak if the was not been inserted properly.nor emptying the cup you need a nice clean toilet where you can remove your parts and a jet to clean the cup properly.nigh chance of the cup falling in the pot and looking it. he v care full not can tie a string to the loop it helps in removal of the cuplunch down fold works the best for me.nnut when i continue to use this cup for the second and third month it did not work as i feel the rigidity of the cup was lost. smooth texture and good for periods but it s loop is bit irritating. although it gives good grip when you want to remove it. overall nice product. good to go. awesome. clean hygienic comfortable and economical.i have been using for months now and it s awesome.all of you please do try.initially there could be seething troubles. dont panic. calmly understand how it works and implement. i am not sure how comfortable it will be for young girls. but married ones can surely attempt.you can forget u have periods. it s that awesome.follow instructions without assumptions.experience will be smooth.none shape suits me quite fine. i married into a family that makes me “sit” or isolate for my period. his is so convenient nothing to dispose. secretly sterilise. it’s a little uncomfortable for first few minutes but it’s so comfortable later. i even forgot i was on my period. i washed it with soap and inserted it. i think experience will make it more easy to use and i’ve only used it for two periods. in the heavy flow days i found medium size is not enough. definitely not overnight. a pad is needed as there will be overflow i have to change the m cup every two hours. i have one baby born vaginal. i will try the large size and see. i fold and insert it and mostly it unfold and it’s ok. trick to removing is to break the seal first by putting a finger in till the rim and folding it and only then removing it. by squatting or sitting and creating pressure like popping will bring the cup out then seal can be broken easily by inserting a finger till the rim and folding the cup. it will be little mess according to your skill. i watched a instagram account called period nirvana which has a lot of into about these cups and discs. that is totally unrelated to this brand. being a mother of a child. i purchased a large size cup but i face some issue with cup.no used a push down method but its leak.while sitting on floor cup comes down. i dont know why. may be there is a size issue or what.non my heavy day it fill up and leak :face with rolling eyes: i have to go to mushroom after 1 hour to empty it.of anyone have any idea of this then please share. i m surprised why have other bands not done this yet. it is the same as any menstrual cup from other perspective. inserting is also the same. but the loop is whole gamechanger when it comes to pulling the cup out. it was so difficult with other cups to dig your fingers hold the stick and use your nails. now i won t have to face that issue ever again. absolutely brilliant easy to use have been using for 2 years easy to use his menstrual cup has made me forget my period days and now even on my period i have no problem going on a vacation going in the pool beach etc. . often at the day end i suddenly remember i am still on my period and should not forget to empty the cup. i have tried several menstrual cups from iron to i active to now and i have struggled with either the cup not properly opening up once inside or i have struggled to get a good hold while pulling it out. i am 40 and have delivered a baby but via c section hence the recommended l size perhaps was too big for me in most bands. size m worked perfect for me after trying many bands but i still struggled to pull the cup out which ah has solved for me. the ring design of ah has made pulling out extremely easy and the cup opens up without any problem once inside. a menstrual cup steriliser i use iron steriliser and aah cup period days sorted good product to recommend his is a very easy to use cup because of the round loop at the bottom as it becomes very easy to hold while removing the cup. its specially easy for people who keep the nail extensions or false nails. his is my first cup. i have been using it for 2 cycle now and these are my observations: no. it’s a beginner friendly cup insertion and removal is very easyno. the material used is not great. it’s too soft and doesn’t pop open easily. i have tried many many folds and positions but due to the softness of the material it becomes a little difficultno. leakage may occur as the material cannot hold its shape as a result of which the suction power isn’t great eitherno. i ordered m size but they gave an s size. their seizing is a little inconsistent.noverall i would say if you are at home and are just getting into trying out cups you can give this a go. use it with back pads. once you get the hang of it switch to a better quality cup if you think menstrual cups are something you would like to continue using. i like it comfortable holds for long his but as i said checkout the video for mode into had speculation on how this would turn out but i m really happy to say how easy it was to use. had my first rash free period and was so comfortable that i even forgot i had it in me while working. the ring design is really helpful when it comes to removal.no m really happy with the cup and happy that i made a good choice for turning to menstrual cups.also i m glad that it didn t hurt. i have been searching for a good alternative to pads for ve long n just of happy i found this menstruation cup.take it from me it has a ve good quality and nice shape especially that ring design which is of convinient to help get cup out. of you once tried it you will never go back for pads menstrual cup easy to put on and easy to take off hygienic good material. i m writing this review after using it for a week this is the 2 central cup this is so much more comfortable. it s unfordable and also comfortable.not may consider it. the menstrual cup from ah is a lifesaver. i used it during my last 2 cycle and experienced leak free and rash free period. the rim is not too hard which makes insertion easier. the cup is not too soft and not too hard it is firm enough to fit inside without hurting your canal. use good quality menstrual cup wash to clean the cup. been using it for years now it s reliable comfortable and i love it because of the ring pulled. unfordable as well :smiling face with smiling eyes: it s shape is made in such a beautiful way round smooth edges are easy to insert. and circular extension give very easy removal. i ordered strong cup before this but it was too uncomfortable to remove because of straight extension.nest cup go for it it s hard leads and hurts a lot while inserting and withdrawal. only plus point is the ring for removal. you always feel something hard is inside you. a big no. i m using menstrul cups since last 2 year but let me tell u to remove it is always scratch and always difficult to pull a little silicon thread using or wet hands.nut this is what i really want. i m writing this after 3 months or 3 use. it s really easy to use and very much easy to remove without pinched or hair or skin.thanks ah menstrual cup large size fits really well and stays in position without any problems. it is actually comfortable and nice for periods.recommend it to those looking to try menstrual cup for the first time. moved the product. very east to use. last to remove because of the ring holder and section works well too. opens up every time and i dont have to bother about the leakage everything else is same as you would get in other bands. the only plus and big one is the round loop for pulling the cup out. his has added to the ultimate ease of using sensual cups. well done for thinking this :thumbs up light skin tone: comfortable fit and easily removable during night it leaned may be suction is not good enough the attached ring is very useful to pull the cup out without slipping it was my and cup . first i had bought large size by mistake and also that cup had stem to pull out which was pitching from inside. when i found it it was just what i needed ring instead of stem is best imagined it allow us to pull vasili and comfortable have been waiting so long for a good product. started using menstrual cup medium size and love it. just perfect. the ring design at the bottom makes it perfect product. i’ve been using menstrual cups for nearly 4 years now. i thought i should get a back cup as well. but this cup is too soft and doesn’t create suction causing leads. it also takes forever to open up and the ring feature would have been a help if the cup actually created suction. i prefer firmer cups so won’t be using this or buying this again. must buy product. feels comfortable. i m using it from last 2 months. like it so much. overall good. it completely depend on person to person. someone may feel fit but someone may feel it uncomfortable. it takes sometimes to be comfortable with usage. select right size for you. brought size m . easy to use and easy to store. because of hook design it is easy to pull out as well. i don t have to worry for 12 hours and even no irritation as well. gros:no. the product is very easy to useno. very easy to insert because of its super soft materialno. very easy to take out because of the loop grip at the endno. size adequate to hold for hours or morennone: very very soft because of this it doesn open up inside and doesn hold its shape.nverdict : useless piece of soft material. will not recommend. your cup needs to be firm to hold its shape and to work its suction inside. please don t go for such waste ultra soft cup. i have always wanted something that was better for the environment than just pads. i don t like using so many in just a few days so when i saw posts about sanitary cups for women on instagram i got one right away i feel so much less stressed about my time of the month. doesn t suction well since it s not firm. the ring design seemed great but due to the poor material and structure it causes leads and does not stick. to for brand strong. his is a save during my swimming. extremely satisfied its super comfortable easy to use.best part is the take out system ring like which makes it more easier to pull out.good quality silicon although i got the wrong size but customer care service helped me out very well.i loved it. thankyou amazon:thumbs up::grinning face with big eyes::red heart: too flies doesn t suction well since it s not firm. the ring design seemed great but due to the poor material and structure it causes leads and does not stick. the one with a ring was why i picked this cup. and it has been soon convenient to use. easy to use at the same time… i would recommend the products each pp of univers v women must use this best the best productnavy to usenot can sit and push this product inside no harmful nothingclean the cap properly while you using king is truly a life save but the cup is soft and doesn t pop properly ends up with leak. must go fr it girls nag can match the comfort of menstrual cup it s nice but seems too big for me otherwise everything is ok with the product just like others must started with menstrual cup this is my st buy but got exactly what i was searching for it comes with super cut packing.nous it has a very convenient ring design at the end which makes the experience a whole lot comfortable.highly recommended. must buy very convenient comfortable king at the base helps in removal because fingers can get slippery sometimes. i ll buy another one. despite multiple attempts it didn t pop open or wasn t able to hold the shape inside. i loved the product. am a new user for sensual cups and this made it so easy for me to use than a normal menstrual cup . the packing is reliable . overall am very satisfied i have honestly stopped using pads cut menstrual has been super life changing.no don t think will use pads again. his ring feature is sooooo much easier than thenormal thing to pull it out with. to worth the price. all do buy. i wore it for 8 straight hours during my very heavy flow and no leakage whatsoever. only if u insert it properly . feels comfortable.must buy. completely necessary and so come. highly recommended i was received a small size in spite of ordering medium size. after using the product there was leakage. also it can be used only when you be at home. an t think of using outside due to hygienic condition. disappointed the top part of the cup is too tough and hurts while inserting the cup and the silicon below the top ring is too soft and is difficult to adjust. all in all an inconvenient cup to use.no.s. i ve used a few cups before this and sharing this review based on relative experience feels like plastic and not at all comfortable i have tried least 5 different bands but was not satisfied with the comfort. ah is the perfect fit for me. i have never been so happy very comfortable the removing part is easy thanks to the product design. very soft unable to use.suction very bad life is a bliss to for it i have 4 5 type of cup but finally i got my cup. very useful i tried this menstrual cup several times but everytime it started leaking. may be its because of soft silicone. i have used see safe hard silicon menstrual cup before. that was leak proof. but i found that cup hard to pull out so i ordered this menstrual cup with ring. but everytime it fails to form the suction. i m going to throw it. was don t buy this worst product its really so hard to insert and still in not able to insert properly. its very much hard and size is too big even though it is small. really disappointed very inconvenient to use as it s very thick i tried it multiple times n every time it has caused me a lot of pain. very bad product this is a waste of money. like it is leaking at night i had severe back ache after using the cup went back to using disposal pads i had immediate pain relief and it s not comfortable i feel there is something inside his was my fourth cup. i tried several bands like safe presage bound cup and then came acrothis cup 2 years ago . the ring shape was appealing. it s been 2 years now since i have been using this cup this is the most comfortable one for a beginner as well as for a veteran cup user . must go for this. good quality it s more comfortable . hard material go for caries strong. its softer than this. it’s not good please don’t buynot leads size large order ilya the but small size mild take this product not comfortable the quality of the material. when i was travel got too much problem it’s 4 times leak in a day after interval his.before i used iron cup it’s very comfortable for 10hrs so now come back to strong cup again. it was easy to insert but it leaned too much. to no point keeping it. maybe it was too small for me i m 29 and 60kgs must use some coronet oil on the outer side if you have problem while inserting the cup inside to its ring: if you are scared it may go very inside tie 6 inch ribbon to pull it out easily prince m using tampons which are insanely costly therefore this cup is a life.net yourself 2 cups and a cup sensitive your life is saved forever.literally pad free and campan free

long review. to please bear with me : nn• k so quite simply a menstrual up is a bell shaped menstruation product that you insert into your vagina don t lip out i ll get to the how and why and is it safe soon and has a stem at the bottom to help pull it out when it s full.please watch tutoring video to learn the insertion removal of menstrual cups. i use the “punch down” fold and began by putting one leg up on a surface and squatting a bit. is with everything practice and patience makes perfect : nn• it s reliable so it s pretty much a 2 time investment at the most one cup can be used up to 8 10 years co friendly no later or rubber or any kind of chemicals gets gets rid of period blood rashes and smells because it is the only product that collects blood as opposed to absorbing it.nn• to rashes. to smell. to icky of something s rubbing against my vagina all day.nn• menstrual cups are made from medical trade silicone. the same thing used in babies feeding bottle nipples. to it doesn t react to the body. it blinds right in.nn• now because it collects blood inside the body your period blood gets very limited exposure to oxygen and that pretty much cuts out the period smell you re used to.which is a result of blood coming in contact with air.nn• it is also infection free because unlike pads you aren t subjecting your vagina to any toxins like you would with the elastic/later/ well from lads or tampons. also because tampons and lads absorb blood they also absorb moisture from your vagina leaving it dry and itchy. while cups just collect blood.nn• to the up can t get lost inside of you.the path connecting your vagina to youruterus is too narrow for a up to pass through. to it left an t go all the way up guns nn• to here s the thing. when the up is inserted correctly it forms a suction with the vaginal all without any air pockets and stands in place to collect the blood without leads. for a regular flow change the up once every 12 hours. in my may 1 and 2 i try and change once every 8 hours. i begin to feel it become full though i ve forgotten a couple times and faintly spotted. to overflowing leads though that s very very rare and i ve personally never heard of it nn• before and after your menstrual cycle nboil of. will a vessel with water and boil it along with the up. his sterilizes it. i usually wait for the water to properly start buzzing and bubbling.nn• yes they actually work and many women in the west have been successfully using them for close to a decade now. the movement is still new here in india but it s going to explode. take my word for it or the women ve subverted nthat’s all from my side it would have been better if it was colourless reviewing it after using it for 2 monthstwitching to menstrual cup was the best decision i have ever made the only regret was that i didn make it sooner:grinning face with sweat:andros :no. using cup does not lead to any kind of rash or infection unlike pads and campanno. after wearing it you can even feel it inside youno. provide more physical mobility than that of pad. g: swimming running riding etc.no. easy to carry while travelling also comes with a cut cloth pouch to store no. economicalno women spends minimum around k k per year for tampons and pads. investing in menstrual cup worth 250 300rs is worth it you can refuse it for least 5 6 yearsno. also good for the environment.nnone :well there aren t any sons of using menstrual cupsnot would take 1 or 2 cycle to get use to the product about how to be sure the cup is fitted properly. for me it took me 1 cycle to get use to it. but once you get use to it there is no going back:hundred points::crossed fingers light skin tone: i ve been using it since 2 months.and to be honest it is way too comfortable.at first it s difficult to use but eventually you ll learn.cleaning and storing is easy.so a it s a nice one time investment product. just that it holds the smell for so long also it is little rough although everything is good these are good and easy to use but after several uses i m finding it leaking not sure why vice quality and build.not is useful than other cheap products. must ho for it nice product easy to insert 1 first of all don t go according to your childbirth status while buying a cup go according to the length of your cervix. measure that against the length of the cup the cup should be at least 1 cm smaller or the stick which is needed for removal will stick out and you will feel it constantly. a cup that is too long will definitely leak and be difficult to insert.no the silicon is medium soft. i don t recommend this menstrual cup for women with a weak pelvic floor you re going to feel it and it will be uncomfortable.no please be aware that you can cut yourself while inserting or removing it. take sure your nails are short.no the suction air holes aren t great and it doesn t always open up inside so i have to make sure it s open halfway through. of you insert it all the way in while closed and it doesn t open and this part is a hit or miss then it ll leak.no it s best to have two on hand so you can alternate them. hygiene is paramount to avoid risk of infection so hands have to be washed the cups have to be washed with soap/hot water and kept in a hygienic container. you need a clean bathroom to yourself for this work. you have to wear at least a party line in case of leakage.no once you figure it out your periods will be shorter you ll save money on pads help reduce plastic in the environment and be able to sleep all night peacefully without having to get up and change. to it s worth it. although i cannot make it out of the product was opened or not but the container’s cover was open when delivered to me. of you are a been or in your was and looking for good menstrual aid this is completely for you. were i m 19 to with my st experience of menstrual cup. trust me girls you ll forget your pads after this. it s very easy to use though. it won t effect your virginity for sure. of any mon is reading this please support your daughters as my mother did :folded hands:. met her enjoy and live those days without any worries.:grinning face with big eyes: every girl should be aware of it. it last please check your croix length before buying any menstrual cup that would do a great help. it is very soft and hence does not open after going inside. it is

this is a life save during my periods. the absolute clean feeling away from pads no rashes what so ever plus saving the environment in our own little way. initially it takes time getting used to it to be very honest. but please be patient and give it a chance and you won’t regret it at all. irrespective of the fact you are married or unmarried you can use it. depending on your flow you can decide the size s m or l. moving on to the recommended fold is slightly difficult so i personally like punch down and fold. very comfortable easy to use store best product :red heart: go for it without any fear . enjoy the life with strong. perfect product. good quality and packing was also perfect.nproduct s price also perfect not less nor high.nno recommend to use. i am writing this for those who are in much confusion about size. us i am using it from 18 months and it is really awesome. i didn t get anything good more than this before. only pain can make you feel that you are in period. to tension of leakage. you can choose size according to age and all mentioned above. it is one time investment. to waste of money. just it once good product strong menstrual cup is easy for use and cleaning price is less than other bands nice product value for money ok its leaking and the suction power is not good its easily come out west ever. love it. i usually don t write reviews so count this as an additional star rating.the iron cup is superb and a must buy for all women.nandros no to stains to leads no fear whatsoever.nno to duckwalking to asking your friends check out your backside literally does not feel like you are on your period.nno good sleep because obviously again there is absolutely no fear of any staining.nno you can see and measure bleeding if medially needed for cod / excessive bleeding nno environmental friendly. i absolutely love it as i don t have to be embarrassed when segregating and throwing my garage. the garage people ornothers in the house don t need to know anything. i can be cranks of without creating any pus garage.nno reusable. after or/and before every use just boil the cap out of it in and refuse. i am now planning to give away the unused packets of napkins asnno just realised how much its eating up my cupboard space. to money spent every cycle and no need to carry around stuff or beg/borrow/steal napkins fromngirls around you on the big day.nno it is so bloody liberating put intended nno i dont know how but it kind of helps with the cramps. either they really do reduce or we get something else to think about. either case i amnhappy to miss out on the cramps.nnone no on t wear it unless the bleeding has properly started and it is not just sporting. stop wearing before it completely ends. the bleeding actuallynhelps as a lubricant when inserting and removing so it is needed.nno ladies who are not aware of their bodies either not sexually active or not adventurous enough may find this a bit overwhelming. the insertionndoes need expertise and a few cycle worth of practice. couture video for the best fold way to insert are a good place to get educated.nno you must have a dedicated wash / bath room to clean this out twice a day or more if you bleed more. its just a small blood soaked murder scene innthe mushroom and then you are done with it. not really a con but its not as easy as changing a sanitary napkin.nno the stem of the cup may need to be trimmed. his stem is rather annoying and tends to stick out quite literally and may become annoying. again nthis is a personal choice and ease of use as in the initial few days the stem is needed to remove the cup. once you are expert at it you can just pushnit out like you do a baby ;p those who understand this reference will probably not need the stem ; p nno girls with irregular cycle may still have to carry around a napkin least for the start day. west can be managed by the cup.nlast but not the least this is a must must must have.no am never going back to the regular napkins ever again. its a liberating enriching experience and for the first time in so many years i found myselfnnot grumbling about the monthly blood felt. its cool to live with it now.nhope the review helps it lead to itchiness i have been using these cups from past 6 months and i use medium size cups. one can use it unto 12 his without experiencing any leakage. very good,https://www.amazon.in/Sirona-Approved-Reusable-Menstrual-Silicone/dp/B07BZG3BY5/ref=sr_1_18?crid=1H94OLN6PX1I2&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.IBcLhChdzpTkrnQnb6fDzzUr3pFubXzT_zUq65uO37VLpCaDlg8051biiX70QMp5z2Q73dYEx6jA356rvitQJlgk8Q4cpo1Wry3JXZJpR7eT_7YqwEWQocaUpE6hZeWQu7Pl_mFZFs1BnS9HX2PKWnilLHWq1xlMov_5vNmSIe1TSHxgbVnEsXwgG1UpDsPynKeLGKTVYR5z9b5dxqw7wTuiCkcHW6jgLdV4Qg7Qer3AEeW_17aXn3MZ8bax1O_7R5eQPmMwYQ-beuO_Ur1NhGroKBuWEPDHxgZpzQd3378._Re01IMHO8B5dRHTSRO-6jt0qiQjFrG0heGsvacAqXI&dib_tag=se&keywords=women+menstrual+cups&qid=1722587880&sprefix=women+menstrual+cups%2Caps%2C251&sr=8-18,0.26381891419579884,0.217,0.063,0.72,1.0

changing product from overseen. not at all good. to suction not at all happy thrown out in sustain on trying for st time i heard about pad free periods during a women s day lecture being delivered by a gynaec. the rash free period term attracted me a lot. i watched many video about how to use it and then thought to give it a try.nearing it for the first time was a bit difficult but it becomes easy later on. i chose an l size but i think smaller size would have worked as well because i usually dont bleed heavily.now i am using it in my second periods and i truly recommend it very good വളരെ of്ല product his is really a boon to all females. i am impressed in very first time. although it was little rustle to insert very first time but i could make it. and i forgot that i am on my periods. his was first time i enjoyed my periods. everyone should go with it. his is wonderful but first time i have faced inconvenience. what i did is i have slightly cut the string which is there in the opposite side of cup . one side cup mouth another side . long string .nonce i have cut it to little my inconvenience is gone . excellent one . hell with the napkins .nnow that trouble is gone forever with this one . thanks to seventeen very good product it is was invention a girl must try this oncenot will take time fr or body to accept it but believe me its awesomthe only problem i have is i dont know why it down t open inside i tried to pinch rotate every thing but still its not leaking that plus point since i don t have too much bleeding. its ok forme. so far its leakproof.first two or times it was a discomfort for me. but now i am used to it.name bye to pads. i am released from maintaining pads and destroying it. the is my first try on this kind of cup. though i have to have more practice i feel this is very good for the environment. i am ok with this for the price paid. very good initiative and like the product. its comfortable. off u are using first time do use with pads as it will take time getting used to this. 2 thumbs up i i have used seventeen menstrual cup at the time of my periods instead of sanitary pads.its very easy to use and clean.the best thing is its comfortness.when we put sanitary pads rashes occurs but by using these menstrual cup it s not happening.it won t leak when it s over bleeds.its very helpful for every women and it s very safe and ease to clean.i strongly recommend these product.i am happy to buy these product. i have been using menstrual cups for close to 4 years now and i love them. however this particular cup which i was forced to buy for an emergency same day delivery is the world s most horrible cup. the material is so so thin that the cup will not open inside. hence it will definitely leak. it is not impossible to make it open but then you have to spend a lot of time trying to get it to open every time. horrible horrible experience. i ve thrown it away after one day of trying and failing. i requested amazon to duelist the product too. initially it was hard to use and was not properly setting inside.now i m happy to use this product.no have said bye bye to sanitary pads.extremely comfortable. of you insert it correctly nothing can be better than this. after using it you are free to do any thing like exercise swimming etc. i like dis product.:thumbs up: i highly recommendproduct is awesome easy to use but heavy flow time i suggest special in night use party line as a safety with this product for first time users don t scared girls this product is best no irritation no bad smell and very easy to use before buying in very scared but after when i first time use i feel very comfort no bad smell no irritation you forget your period this product is awesome every girl should buy this. it s very good product :smiling face: i really like to use easily n very comfortable and not leak anymore i so happy to use this cup :face blowing a kiss::face blowing a kiss::face blowing a kiss::face blowing a kiss::face blowing a kiss: seriously highly recommended to all girls n every woman s to use this cup. good product it s very easy to use the quality is very poor.pus don t waste or money buying it. very woman should go for menstrual cups. take any brand it’s revolutionary guns double amazing product as per by wife thought.i purchased this product for by wife who was very frustrated at this time.but in this month she used this product.and she said to me. finally i m actually free in mensuraion period.it is very easy going used.also leak roof product. and the was very happy with this product.that s why i highly recommended.nthanku for this product. to for it ladies am having best period experience with these cups. its easy to use and very soft to your vaginal area.nor first time users you might feel it little front but trust me after using it you will never look back to pads and tampons no give this product a try and enjoy your periods. thank you it is a good product.but i wish the material could be more softer. i find it little stiff and slightly hard. but other wise it does great job. for the first time it s difficult to use it for me it took 12 hours to put it correctly but afterwards it is the best without leak smell and environment safety its good for not heavy period.for heavy period you need to take out after 3 to 4 hours i will not say it s easy to use but only practice can make your technique better. it s just awesome.after using 10 months i m writing review.one u insert it in and forget it u r even on or periods.quality is amazing of d product.on first use u will find little hard but later on after one on two sterilisation it will become so soft and u will find it very easy to insert. not comfort fit. after inserting it is in the same shape. it will not retain

face with hearts: is i have ordered this because i heard from my friend also she used it and she said she didn t felt that she is on her periods so i also thought of buying this. i was thinking about it from past few months but then i finally decided that ok lets buy it. today was my second day and i didn t wanted to try it on my first day because already my periods were 3 days late and i didn t wanted to give more stress to my body. to i today took the shower and tried inserting it first attempt was a fail it was painful then i tried the second time and it was extremely painful then i thought ah i can t do it this is not donna work for me. when i tried for third time this time i relaxed and took the deep breath and then i tried punch down method and i tried inserting it and then it slowly went inside but it was a little painful then i washed everything and went out for a while i felt like there is something then i thought its because my whole attention is towards it that s why i can feel it and then it was a weird experience like you are having a very bad cramps but there no pads. i was brave enough to not put any party line or pads for extra security because i knew its sealed there. when i took my painkillers because it was too weird then my pain was also gone because i took the medicine and then i walked around and sat and everything was fine and i forgot about the struggle which i did to insert it and i said to my sister that i will for sure switch to menstrual cup because its my second day and i feel so relieved that i am not having pad its like a regular day . i was happy then after few hours i went to toilet and i saw a minute drop of blood then i thought i should take it out and should throw away the blood and insert it again and then i went inside bathroom. to this is scar. i touch my that area and the stem of cup by which we are suppose to pull it out it was not there then i put my finger a little inside it was painful then i felt that stem and then i was trying to grab a grip over that stem but it was inside then i remembered that in morning i read this one girl s comment and she was just 17 and she explained how she pulled out her menstrual cup by pushing it by abdominal muscles at first i was scared that its never donna come out i was horrified then i pushed with my abdominal muscle then that little stem came a little out so i tried pulling it but the cup was still not coming out so i stressed out a little and then i tried putting finger inside to break the suction and let me tell you that was a horrible and painful experience i was trying so hard to break the suction it s not the same as they show on video it s not that easy at all its painful i cut my nails small but still i was afraid that what if i will get the cut and will get the infection then i i tried again and i pulled it out finally but there was blood all over in my bathroom . it was gross then i washed it properly and then i tried reinstating it again and then again it was painful and i was already in so much stress then second time i tried it was a fail and painful then i took a deep breath and i tried pushing it inside and i pushed it inside and then i washed myself and i washed my bathroom and then i came out and this time that little stem which is used to hold a grip and pull out is poking me its painful now. to this was my first time using it and it was a sweet and spice experience and now when i will take it out again that will decide if i should switch to menstrual cups or not . but the peaks of having menstrual cup is that you don t feel like that you are on your senses but for that feeling going all through this much pain is a big no i feel if there was a easier way to insert and take out then i would have loved it moved it quality comfortable reasonable very convenient to use i bought medium size.it was not my size.i need large. up is made with soft material easy to put in but the stem is too long which irritated a lot.not was a wonderful product if the stems were kept little smaller. even if one will trim the stem it will become sharp and will spoke you a lot. to ahead and purchase it without a

face with hearts: is i have ordered this because i heard from my friend also she used it and she said she didn t felt that she is on her periods so i also thought of buying this. i was thinking about it from past few months but then i finally decided that ok lets buy it. today was my second day and i didn t wanted to try it on my first day because already my periods were 3 days late and i didn t wanted to give more stress to my body. to i today took the shower and tried inserting it first attempt was a fail it was painful then i tried the second time and it was extremely painful then i thought ah i can t do it this is not donna work for me. when i tried for third time this time i relaxed and took the deep breath and then i tried punch down method and i tried inserting it and then it slowly went inside but it was a little painful then i washed everything and went out for a while i felt like there is something then i thought its because my whole attention is towards it that s why i can feel it and then it was a weird experience like you are having a very bad cramps but there no pads. i was brave enough to not put any party line or pads for extra security because i knew its sealed there. when i took my painkillers because it was too weird then my pain was also gone because i took the medicine and then i walked around and sat and everything was fine and i forgot about the struggle which i did to insert it and i said to my sister that i will for sure switch to menstrual cup because its my second day and i feel so relieved that i am not having pad its like a regular day . i was happy then after few hours i went to toilet and i saw a minute drop of blood then i thought i should take it out and should throw away the blood and insert it again and then i went inside bathroom. to this is scar. i touch my that area and the stem of cup by which we are suppose to pull it out it was not there then i put my finger a little inside it was painful then i felt that stem and then i was trying to grab a grip over that stem but it was inside then i remembered that in morning i read this one girl s comment and she was just 17 and she explained how she pulled out her menstrual cup by pushing it by abdominal muscles at first i was scared that its never donna come out i was horrified then i pushed with my abdominal muscle then that little stem came a little out so i tried pulling it but the cup was still not coming out so i stressed out a little and then i tried putting finger inside to break the suction and let me tell you that was a horrible and painful experience i was trying so hard to break the suction it s not the same as they show on video it s not that easy at all its painful i cut my nails small but still i was afraid that what if i will get the cut and will get the infection then i i tried again and i pulled it out finally but there was blood all over in my bathroom . it was gross then i washed it properly and then i tried reinstating it again and then again it was painful and i was already in so much stress then second time i tried it was a fail and painful then i took a deep breath and i tried pushing it inside and i pushed it inside and then i washed myself and i washed my bathroom and then i came out and this time that little stem which is used to hold a grip and pull out is poking me its painful now. to this was my first time using it and it was a sweet and spice experience and now when i will take it out again that will decide if i should switch to menstrual cups or not . but the peaks of having menstrual cup is that you don t feel like that you are on your senses but for that feeling going all through this much pain is a big no i feel if there was a easier way to insert and take out then i would have loved it moved it quality comfortable reasonable very convenient to use i bought medium size.it was not my size.i need large. up is made with soft material easy to put in but the stem is too long which

ought them again now. something about their silicon has changed since 2018 and the cup just sides in and seals instantly.no ahead and buy. is a first time user of menstrual cups i have found some pro and sons about it. i never really cared about the whole save the planet aspect of reliable products th. the only thing i think about during my periods is how to make it easier for myself. the only reason i bought this product was to save some money in. but usually tampons are my go to product. but if you re looking for reliable products to lessen your waste then this is definitely a better option than reliable pads in terms of hygienicandros its great if you want to save money that you d be spending on pads or tampons. hats initially why i wanted to even try this.n its not so bad once you get the hang of it. and as long as you follow instructionsn lasts for a few years.none oh boy do i have a few of these. for states it want easy to insert. i followed the instructions and did the u fold shape and tried to insert it. it hurt.n the most important con for me is the emptying it out part. it feels really gross. not to mention if you re out at work or somewhere public its pretty impossible to wash. a lot of public restrooms don t have water. and even if they do you really can t trust how clean it is. considering this is something you have to insert into your body you could end up with an infection if the water isn t clean. to there s no way i would use this unless i was at home. tampons are my go to option for when i m out so i can dispose of it and use a new one when needed. sanitising the cup is very importwant before using it againnedit: after using it for a couple of years give gotten the hang of using it. it doesn t hurt. i wasn t doing it properly before i think. it s mess free. to don t worry about it. it takes some getting used to but i absolutely love it now. i carry a bottle of boiled water with me when i go out to wash it if needed. but i usually don t require it unless its the heaviest day. but i haven t used tampons or pads since i got these. its worth the buy ladies. it makes life easier life changing moment when i started using it. it was in my cart since one year i wasn t sure to use it. but since last 8 months i m using it and it became a limestone in my life. sometimes i forgot that i m on my periods. it s that much comfortable. very women who are using pads till now. must buy and use a menstrual cup. value for money three stars due to rushed cover should be very careful else they cause infection… there is an outer plastic covering on the cup to prevent contamination… but still…. it is indeed a good product just as the no.1 rating. am satisfied u can also try it without any worries. i am using this item for the last six months. his is the most comfortable item i would say. new things i would like to mention about my experience while using this product.no it creates so much sensation for the first few days. gradually that feeling has gone.no it the time of inserting you have to forcibly push it deep inside and then pull it outward to see if it is stuck properly in the groove. his can lead to unpleasant situations if it does not get stuck inside properly. it was my st time that i used a menstrual cup it was a tough task in the beginning or i would say it was a ll tricky but the time you learn how to insert nd how to remove it.you ll find it to be better than pads.you just need a little practice then and dude of will of a goodbye of pads forever. from then periods won t be dirty nd irritating.just a little practice that s all you need.nd just don t give up.once you know how to do it you ll feel the comfort.i assure you :hundred points: good product wonderful product easy to use and no leads. i m happy i m very comfortable while using the proud good quality easy to use worth the price.it is safe and secure.i think married women should at least try it once. it is not easy to use and if it not fitted properly then leakage will happen so we have to use it carefully. everything is fine but medium size cups are not suitable for people in was i think they can go with small size cups good very comfortable product for menstrual time easy to use cry to use it.thank you :thumbs up: it suited me well . comfortable really nice experience. i would request everyone to change over to cups . its

write this review after 2 years which i bought it from may th 2022. his is so comfortable for me first when i use get light irritation but now fine also slightly better from the pain :winking face with tongue: no stain and easy to use key fellow menstruater.no have been using a menstrual cup for a really long time. i thought to buy a spear one. i don t really need to his one s clot different than the current one that i am using. were are few imp points about this one.nno. his is for the people who have low croix during their periods you can check how to measure or croix online . people with high croix will have a problem pulling it out.nno. it s a little bit harder where the one i am using is quite soft. to if or first time cup user then i don t think this one s the right one.nno. it has quite clot of holes at the rim where mine has only two. but i think that s for the best it will be easy for the removal but also little prone to leakage if the seal is broken accidentally or due incorrect inserting.nno. it just comes with a bag to keep there s no box kind thing where we can keep it. also the bag i got is a disaster n that s the reason this lost a star.nno. the best part about this of it offers service for like 8 10 years with proper use. which is just great. he will save clot of money there.noverall it s a good one but i won t really recommend for the first time users to buy it though. apt for something smoother than this. and yeah if u are ready to invest more than i definitely recommend u to go for a different brand.nut yes menstrual cups are a great boon for women. i feel so much comfortable it s not just less in cost as compared to pads but way more comfortable you can use this according to size and don t worry about that baby i m margin this product don t harm you in any way use this and make your periods easy and cut your cost from huge product punched his product is a wonder. absolutely no leakage no stain no mess no wet feeling no embarrassment no garage. comfortable regular tap water wash unable and u can do anything wearing it including swimming.nnot was a bit difficult to insert take out at first but few times later it became fine. and once its in u can t feel it which frees u from embarrassments of using pads.nvery it ladies switch to menstrual cups. price starts from 250 300 only which u spend on pads for months only. it also reduce the garage of used pad on earth and frees u from the tension of disposal of used pads.very very happy with the product.nthank you amazon for this product. it is really a good and handy product. does what it claims. and still in a bit dissatisfied with it for not taking out the odour completely from my menstural cup. but its a okay product. you can buy it it s been almost 2.5 years have been using menstrual cup it s really worth it every penny once or used to it loved it in terms of comfort leakage prevention feel thankful that a lot of sanitary waste is prevent .nthankyou . it has only html capacity we should remove for every hour otherwise its leak if we go outside we should wear pad with this otherwise keep one pair of dress. its not fulfill above the information which they have mention in the product details ex: 8 hours to use but it is only maximum 2 hours coming we should we must change and re use for every 1 houruncomfortable is good it s a really good product. i ve been using it for more than 2 yes i guess. it s really good. it was great experience to use menustral cup . thank you for making it in unfordable range . now i have confidence that i can least use a cup and very perfect size. even though i am adult been size was perfect for menut i have suggestions for u ply try to make it softer. it is very hard that i couldn t insert it at start.nearly i lost it in toilet as it slipped and bounded out of my hand while removing. may be u can work on it and make easy to remove. may be ring is better than stick so that one can hold it i used it for the st time today i was worried about it.but but .it was way 2 good then my imagination i ll say its hard to get in n out i guess it ll be easier with practice .but after 10 or 15 min u ll feel like u don t have periods at all n ll feel free for next 8 hours awesome product go for it initially it ll take some time but its worth a try his is my second divan cup after using my first for 3 years. unlike the first everett is easier to use because it opens up inside the body without much haste. this is what i liked the most. you don t have to squat down or anything. everything else is the same as other cups. super come leak free economical u don t have to go buy pads every month no difficulty in disposing can sleep anyway you want. i just love it by previous purchase was from seventeen co. ch leaned a lot at night most mornings. and sometimes during day and when or out it was too risky.n so wanted to try other with different size and this one if worn right way it was a wonder to me.n it s all about the quality and lot of patience and right tetanic it will be easy once u get used to it. i am an allergic person and my skin is extremely sensitive. i hate using pads because i always end up with rashes at the end of my rd day of menstrual cycle. i finally decided to purchase a menstrual cup. when came the task to choose which menstrual cup. i have been using this product for 2 years. according to my experience it is a great product and i will recommend everyone to purchase it. the material is soft and good. easy to use but the small size cup is really too small. i had to change cup every 4 hours or else it would leakn. is good for periods and doesn t caused any infection and doesn t leak at all good his is my first menstrual cup before buying it i researches a lot and found that i should switch. i received the product today n luckily i m on my and day of my periods i quickly sterilised and washed it with a chemical free soap and went to try but after trying for many times i decided not to try more i cannot insert the cup its very difficult the i thought to change my position and tried to insert the it quickly got inside . and it feels like nothing.so be sure about the position and and the fold suitable for you .if figure it out the. congratulations you re ready to enjoy the comfortable periods. 3 was sent to me with 1 month expire date. and it wasn’t written anywhere on ad i bought small size cup although it was easy to insert it got very difficult to remove the cup as i have higher croix. i had some discomfort after i wore the cup and i could feel some prick inside. of you have a lower croix then small would work but for anyone with higher croix medium or large is better for the best fit. his cup was my first one and it was good enough to convert me into a permanent cup user. however it is on the softer side and ended up leaking one night. burns out i need a firmer cup. to now i use it on my lighter days during the day and haven t experienced any more leads so far. hygiene is important for girls so this is what i found most useful on amazon when i use my menstrual cup it is good in smell and in cleaning as well to doubt menstrual cups are best than any other sanitary product. they are comfortable easy to use trash cash rash free. evereve menstrual cup is very unfordable. you just need to pick right size and it takes some time to get your hands on it. after 2 3 period cycle you will experience comfortable periods and will never go back to sanitary pads. it first i was scared to use it but when i tried it it was way too comfortable. i didn t even felt like that i was on my periods. it doesn t leak at all and it s thickness the texture is also very perfect making it flexible yet sturdy. the instructions in the

comfortable and might not be a problem to insert/remove after using it once. although it s leakproof. during those times when you are already in pain it s strong suction makes the insertion and removal more painful. may be the material should be more soft. talking about women hygienic giving tips on it gives me immense pleasure always; as young girls really need to know about these things to

free periods. i switched from sanitary pads to cup as my career asked for the same. i had a bit trouble using it the first time but it works like magic now. i didn t even feel like i was on my periods. no leakage tension at all. i purchased this cup about 11 months back and have been using it consistently even month. his is my first cup. it s honestly very good. i can t compare it with any

difficult to insert and remove but i think it ll take 2 or 3 cycle to be a pro.not s a perfect replacement for sticky pads that cost so much .no more feeling uncomfortable due to pads and changing every 2 his on heavy days.overall it s a good pick. the quality of the product seems good enough but the cup says size s while i ordered a size m . i haven had a chance to use it yet to know how leak proof or comfortable it is i hope the size doesn create an issue. really helpful removed the oder well. used their menstrual cup for barely 8 months as it started leaking heavily suddenly. initially i assumed it would probably be my flow however i observed it for 2 3 of my cycle and compared by using tampons in the previous two cycle. i found out that the cup had gotten damaged within a year. the experience was very uncomfortable and embarrassing. very ease to use finally free from pads key girls i want to share my personal experience about this product :smiling face with open hands:his is must buy product. when you are feeling less bleeding and you don t want to waste your pads than try it is is very good for st nd the last days . am very satisfied with the product and the packing .

have been using this since 10 years and i advocate for this item i even gift it as birthday gifts to ladies known to me. i really feel so much free and clean even when i am in the days of my mensuration. i am not a married woman and i am using it so smoothly and so are my friends both married and unmarried thus the misconception related to it s use are baseless. girls give it a try and the freedom you get will deliver you from distressful days every month. first time use must it be the last time. deep using constantly and gradually it s going to be a habit and you will be free and save so much of money that we use to buy pads every month. to for it very useful product product is very good but the delivery man was rude and asking personal questions it made so uncomfortable that i don t want to shop from amazon again.amazon should do something about it. good quality these cups are remarkable and so comfortable although one need to practice quite time before getting hold of it but after that it’s the most precious thing ever got invented for women. i personally feel like everyone should try it at least once in her lifetime iron is the first sensual cup i ever tried and later i had to purchase a different brand because this one is just too soft that it won t unfold inside you hence doesn t create any strong suction leading to constant leakage. i think they didn t checked their product after production. his is just so irritating the other one is a little hard not too hard but just fine enough to prevent leakage. i won t suggest strong to anyone. his is personally what i could suggest to anyone and i m being very honest here because periods are irritating and leaking is even worse . have safe menstruation girls:cherry blossom: period life has completely changed to heaven like seriously free from rashes pimples uncomfortable infection smells and awkwardness free from all these west way to feel free even in period days. i dint feel like i had periods .my days went so smoothly :slightly smiling face::thumbs up: moves it menstrual cup weather is any size any one can use it. having a believe that you can do it have little patience while trying to insert it and never give up keeping trying again and again gradually you learn how to insert it and remove it. on t panic and fear it completely safe to use. must try once in your life you will never regret . after multiple uses i realised it is actually worth the investment . west product i have purchased so far it made my life easy. i like this i used it once and now i’m not using it not easy to use at first you feel problem but after 2 3 month you will get comfortable to this then you feel nothing is best more then this.this have so many benefits.awesome product you should try.:red heart::red heart::red heart: comfortablehygienicenvironment friendlynon the minus side up starts to leak before it is full. that is the only flaw.otherwise co friendly. comfortable. the suction gave me pain initially but once i learnt to take the air out youtube tutoring it is amazing. it might be uncomfortable at first. but if u give it some time you will find the right way and can use it without worry.:smiling face with smiling eyes: i have used other brand as well that was good and i purchased this one in 6 to 7 qualities but i am not happy with this brand in one or two products there were no leakage but in few i observed leakage.very very bad after using this for the first time i thought cups aren t for me as it caused additional pain and it leaned. the material is rougher than it should be and the size is larger than it should be.flush is working well for me. first use is uncomfortable may be might get used to it later on it first few times it gets little tricky to use but when you will get it how to apply it it s most comfortable thing than all other products for period we are using yet. great product. i highly recommend this to every women out there. it s a 1000 better than any alternative pads/ tampons . very easy to use for the people trying for first time than amazonvery helpful productsatisfied with this productrecommended to buypacking was goodno damageoverall satisfied with this product the inserting and removing of course takes time. but the cup does a good justification for the price and is of good quality. unfortunately i ordered small size . wrong product was delivered but they refused my money. i ordered again and got best product not that comfortable easy to use received on time exact product i ordered packing was very neat. it s an amazing invention i was very much insure if i want to use this product but believe me it s great idea to switch to cups from pad just haste for to weeks to learn to use it. now coming to this product it was great for 3 time use but in my th cycle it became soft and refused to open up the quality is good but not unable. comfortable but not much easy for new one thanks my monthly saviour small size is also very big really amazing perfect worst productnvery hard material is used to make it want be able to use it i don t know why.fit hi ni horsham ordered it for my sister who would stain herself and feel uncomfortable during sports. must have very environment friendly and convenient. his is not mmm this is mmm so hardly making any changes. i ordered this because i wanted a

lifestyle is almost impossible to find because somehow softness of the cup is advertised as something good while it is not always good for some women soft cups won t work. i had used few cups which were on the harder side by the way harder doesn t mean it will hurt or you will feel it etc. it means it will work perfectly if you do sports and have strong muscles . to all the other cups used to leak a little at some point especially in mornings or during exercise. not sufficient so simple paint line helps. but still. his cup i can use freely without party line its perfect. the only con i found is that even after using cups for few years now i find it little bit hard to open in the beginning. it takes some practice to figure it out. but when you do you donna forget about it and that auntie flow is visiting. to i advise beginners to try regular model first. i think it would be easier for first time users. in any case go for this cup with no second thoughts. for this prove range its simply amazing. and i prefer it over some imported highly advertised cups costing around k. i have few if them and this one is better. must don t give up on it learn to used it properly take that study curve and you will be happy with it for sure.nno.s. i figured put the perfect fold for this cup which works like magic: take a cup bend the rim from front down then press the sides together so that it reminds a shape of diamond one side slightly overlapping the other. after this you will never have any problems inserting this cup. takes a second. see the photo attached.nno.s. i have read bad reviews of people who purchased active model of the cup and complaining it is too hard. well active models are hard they are created for those with strong pelvic muscles so be ready it will be on the hard side. of you are not an athlete don t buy an active model buy a normal one. harder cups are incredibly rare hence i am grateful to this brand for having it specifically. unfortunately the cup arrived just a day after i finished my cycle thus i didn t get a chance to use it. however the product looks very good and efficient. i love menstrual cups and the one i used before was softer than this one but it never opened inside me properly. ladygo active cup is stiffen and might be the solution for that since stiff cups open easily than soft cups. the cup comes with a good grip at the base and comes with a flat soft stem. by previous cups had stiff round stems which would cause a bit discomfort even after i cut it thus i think the flat soft stem of ladygo cup might be more comfortable. the length is short which i like because my croix sits low on the first 3 days of my period.more importantly the brand focused a lot on customer support and will help you with whatever you need and in genuine cases they will also provide a replacement.nside note i have been using cups for a long time now and it took me sometime to learn how to use it but once i did i never looked back on tampons and pads. its very important to choose the right cup and size and also use tube to insert it whenever you can it makes all the difference after twitching to cups i have finally stopped cursing my existence as a woman just because i get periods hata. all the best. standard large size. used a cup for the first time. was comfortable enough and firm enough. used c fold but couldn t figure out if it opened may be due to inexperienced. i have no other cup experience to compare with. removal was bit uncomfortable due to firmness again due to inexperience not the cup per se . any softer would probably be too loose.edit after second cycle. of periods are very heavy better to clean every 3 hours or wear a pad if that duration is inconvenient. changed twice at office. really comfortable c fold is fine easiest to unfold. product didn t work out for me. it s quite big compared to the small sizes offered by other bands.nno would still suggest that you try it out because the material of the cup is very good and it s quite easy to insert. by only issue was that it didn t pop open perhaps because it was too big or too soft for a first time user.ncustomer service however is implacable and they re willing to go out of their way to help you.nof the size isn t an issue you will probably love this because the silicon itself is very comfortable. the stem is the perfect length. it comes with a very helpful manual too. it s stem is flat and has ribs so it hurts very bad everytime i use and is very uncomfortable it was my first experience with menstrual up. i was little scared to use this cup and had lot of misconceptions about menstrual up. i chose this lady brand by reading its reviews.nno. it s really very comfortable you don t even realize that you are on periods.nno. i chose size through their size chart and it s perfect for me.nno. for insertion i have gone through various couture video and it s just that easy. with few easy methods to try.nno. pulling out is not that big deal. it s as easy as inserting the cup.nno. an be used for 4 hours on regular flow. after that just clean it with warm water and liquid cleansed.nno. package is very attractive it has its case with plastic box to store.nno had great experience with lady and menstrual cup. definitely recommended :thumbs up:nclick on the helpful button if you find it helpful. it s not much good as compared to sanitary pads. whenever i use it i felt itchiness and irritation. material it s little bit hard that s why i gave only 2 stars to this product. i suggest you don t buy it :thumbs down: long road to success. i had brought active model in the size large as i m a heavy bleeder and lookout 5 6 days a week.it is tricky to understand which fold suits or body because the cup doesn t open sometimes if u have a stronger vaginal walls. fold works like a magic to me .in the beginning it was difficult to understand when to empty it. since i bleed clot on and day i used to change very 2 hours.if u cycle is normal u can change once in 5 6 hours to prevent overflow and leakage.it is definitely leakproof if u empty it on right time.else the cup will overflow and cause leakage.overall it took me months to understand the process.but i highly recommend this brand as i have tried cup from other bands and this one worked perfectly well for me. aesthetic and the texture of the cup are excellent. the cup is smooth and has no sharp protrusion that may hurt. customer service is good. and although i was under the impression that the cup can be destroyed and exchanged with proof of destruction only croix size issues apparently qualify for exchange.nhowever learning how to use the cup seems like a process and one that will take time to master. spite of using the c fold and trying to insert it while squatting during my period i wasn t able to insert it. after searching for a long time i served down ladygo. the choice was made on basis of the fortifications and the price. is a first time user i was resistant for this transition and i didn t want to spend a lot of money in case i realise that the cups are not for me. i must say that i made a right choice. his cup fits well within the budget and super come. i bought standard cup in small size.nnor the first time users one needs to learn the fold that s most comfortable for them. for me it is punch and fold. once i got hold of this fold there s no looking back. i have used it for three cycle now and i am absolutely satisfied.nno wish the pouch material had been cotton and i find the flies plastic box redundant. i have used this only three times and need to have more experience. everything is good about this cup but the only problem i have is that the stem is too long and you can feel the cup being pushed down. anyway you can cut the stem if you want. they also provide a whatsapp help number and give you full support in case you want any help. must found it so comfortable even though it s the first time i am using a menstrual cup in fact i didn t even feel like it was that time of the month. i could sleep in any position without fear of leakage and go about doing what i normally do every other day. it was also the perfect size for me thanks to the parameter given by lady to. i am so happy that i chose lady to i don t think that i am ever going back to pads. lady to customer care is really amazing and very helpful. i had purchased large size and it was not fitting me hence called them and explained the situation and they helped me to get the right size by asking me to destroy the current one that means they don’t take return and sell the same product to others. very hygienic and genuine. i would suggest others to go with lady to and not other bands. vice product not too soft and not too hard. it fitted perfectly. i already tried now cup n other cups but finally settled on lady go. to leakage at all. only thing is to expertise the art of inserting perfectly.had bought large active model. north buying. i first ordered active model large . which is very hard and uncomfortable. later i thought i should have gone for standard model small just delivered works well and it’s comfortable. i prefer i everyone standard more than active . i haven t enough words to praise this product. that it gives is absolute freedom from stains and rashes for me. i ordered large size but got small. amazon refund me the full amount as no return possible. but later i understood small size is perfect for me. i am 29 and have a baby. after some trials this cup fits with no worries. to pain at all. i recommended this to all my colleagues. very happy with the purchase. lady to menstrual cup is the best change i ever made with regard to my menstrual hygienic. i ve used it for two cycle now and it has been very comfortable without fear of leakage or odour especially while doing exercises. some youtube video helped with ways to insert the cup and practice definitely makes it easy to use. i always wanted to buy menstrual cup but was confused so finally decided to buy this. his brand is terrified.easy to use after 2/3 trials . comfortable and it is soft. i like the packing style as it comes in a container with a pouch to store it. you can choose the cup according to your size chart is given .the best thing is that we dont have to worry about stains anymore. that it gives is absolute freedom from stains and rashes for me. i ordered large size but got small. amazon refund me the full amount as no return possible. but later i understood small size is perfect for me. i am 29 and have a baby. after some trials this cup fits with no worries. to pain at all. i recommended this to all my colleagues. i am really happy after having bought this product. it surpassed my expectations. was made my periods stress free. the initial product i got was a bit uncomfortable for me and so i got in touch with the customer care team and they were very helpful in guiding me and sent me another product of different size. really wonderful customer care team and thanks to amazon for this wonderful product i love this product. i have been using m cup for 5 years. now i needed large size so i went for this. it is easy to use n reliable i am usually not the one to write comment but this cup was so amazing . i ordered the softer cup and it has the perfect firmness. not to hard. but soft enough to make u feel comfortable and suction is also good i never leaned with this good product. but it s not soft so first use was difficult and insertion is also difficult. it s not too hard also have been using since last two years and couldn’t have been happier during periods doesn even feel like i’m having those days no witness no discomfort can even swim using these since no chance of leakage. most importantly i feel proud of no longer contributing to the non biodegradable waste that is caused by sanitary napkins and tampons. good quality menstrual cup. took some time to learn how to use it but that goes for all menstrual cups. the regular cup is too soft and doesn t open easily. i was apprehensive too. when i used it for the first time yesterday i felt scared and it pained too while firing out how it needs to be inserted. while removing too it took me a while.nhowever the second time onward the process was really smooth.nno would say must go for it ladies i am editing my review due to the excellent customer support by lady. i called and shared my experience. i was very impressed with the expert who called me to understand my issues explain and recommended a sport model for my body type. the product was delivered to me without any additional cost.nnor me using a cup is so liberating. by wife have been using another product for the last few years. it was easily stained. his one s seems to have better quality and ease of use. the stem design is far better which solved the problem of rounded stems in other cups. the storage container is an obvious plus. i would prefer softer silicon cups. is a first time user of menstrual cup insertion was bit difficult. but bringing out was easy. it is good overall a very good product at unfordable price. i got it delivered on 23 an during my period . used in two periods successfully. its really easy to use and maintain. just keep on checking after 4 5 hours depending on the flow. a good product i recommend. anything that is revolutionary for a women s health in menstrual hygienic by providing comfort dryness less odour is the ladygo menstrual cup it has safety fortifications also being provided with a handy container that cases for carrying anywhere ought it because it is approved from many countries. but believe me its the best decision. very soft easy to use comfortable and good quality. the storage bag and box are also good in quality. i have also used other bands but this is better than others. must go for it. awesome .no other word to describe it.it feels too comforting.it s perfect for me.the active one.i tired so many other bands.and leakage problem was there.and not opening up inside properly.after twitching to this.i m happy now. i used other products which did not solve the purpose. his

Often similar in design and without much information regarding their origin or material usedHigh Capacity with Unique Stemless Design: A cup capacity of 20 ml and above will give even women with heavy periods 8 hours of capacity at night. Most cups in the market come with a stem. For most women it becomes an irritation and they end up cutting it off. Our u shape gives women a capacity of 23 ml with a length of only 50mm - equivalent of two sanitary pads, while our stemless design made it a lot more relaxing for our cupstersWings Green: A soft cup which is suitable for women with sedentary lifestyle or weaker pelvic floor muscles. Women with bladder issues find this cup more cosy to use.; Healthier, Compact and Discrete : These wings is made from medical grade silicone that is an inert, non-toxic material and is safe on the skin.Eco-friendly, cosy, economical: these wings can be reused multiple times and there is no burden on the environment. No more sanitary napkins strewn on the road or clogged in the drains, you can swim, play water sports, run marathons, do yoga or absolutely anything during periods that you would otherwise avoid. Moreover, its light on the pocketWhy Stemless Menstrual cup? * A menstrual cup is provided with a knob or stem to locate the base, but ladies think that it's there to pull out the cup holding the stem resulting in prolapse or harming the vaginal walls. * If there is no room for stem in the vaginal canal, it pokes and hurts. * The U shape of the cup provides more space to hold more period blood. Maximum capacity yet small and compact in size. * To experience the wow factor, a feeling of not wearing anything.Period days will be just like any other normal day.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71gKQNSBN6L._SY450_.jpg,his is best decision i took so far.no had cheaper choice over it but i took it thinking one time investment completely worth it.ney experience with cheaper one was so painful. i assumed it will be painful as i had no experience before or moment of self love too.not was so smooth and painless and i didn t even feel existence of it or irritating stem. i was so scared while removing but no it was completely painless. you my dear stonesoup changed the way i look at high prices stuff. quality was worth the money u put.earlier one which was cheap i accidently flushed in toilet as it used to bounce a lot. and i was scared of pain. i can t tell u how happy i am. i dont know how but even period pain subsides with menustral cups. i took it for environment. but i will use it for happy period. muhhhhhhhhhno am donna tell thousands of pp about it. and v r must use this green cup using this for a few cycle now and it s a blessing. had to take 2 3 cycle to get used to the cup but now i can t imagine my periods without this.not gets easier to use with practice and the cup also becomes softer after few uses.up are very much co friendly and cost effective. plus since you don t have to carry anything else less luggage is also a bonus. its very good. very soft. size is perfect. must buy. easy to use it first i bought gunner

periods. his cup feels very comfortable. it first it takes time to insert and after 2 or 3 cycle you ll become pro. the flow of period on the first day is normal so i wash it after 10 hours and then refuse it. but the flow on the second day is heavy so i wash it after 6 7 8 hours and sleep with extra security by using a cloth pad only on first and second night . his is the best cup for me. purchased this product after going through the descriptions and reviews of several cups.ney first cup was all cup which i ve been using for two years and decided to give another one a try. all cup is a firm cup so although it might be a had bit uncomfortable to push it through the vagina for insertion the firmness helps to get the cup opened properly once inserted to fit into a vacuum seal.his cup on the other hand is way too soft too small compared to the m size all cup and the softness plus shape of the cup made it impossible to get it to open once inserted. i tried several times but all attempts were in vain. finally had to throw it out. it s a relatively expensive cup and i m really disappointed as i just couldn t use it. very since herd of menstural cups i wanted to buy one my first one was a silk cup which hurt me like hell in all ways may be because i was new to this also post cutting the stem also it kept hurting but i was determined to move on with pads then i came

possible with this one on long drives horse riding trampolines swinging . to leads super comfortnnews buy do or self a favour little too soft it never pips open. i guess this would be ideal for teenager of you are 25 and above go for a firmer cup. even if you are a beginner. of you face issues with insertion use urban biotics aloe vera get. it has zero fragrance or colour and is also began and cruelty free. though i knew about the product many years ago i was so scared to insert something like this. now after using this only for 1 day i regret on delaying myself to take such a great

i have used menstrual cup properly for 5 6 cycle only. however i liked this menstrual cup from gynocup because it s extremely soft colourless with short stem and doesn t stain on usage.nthe other cups that i used one was a colourless one but got stained in the first use itself.and the other one which was coloured also got stained and both had longer stems. for a person like me who has low lying croix longer stems are uncomfortable. and this one is worth the money nno for it girls trust me no need of pads/no tampons no rashes be binds for 12 solid hours do whatever u like just like the sanitary pad as those are hoax his product is a symmetrical funnel does not fit properly. his m up does not fit me. but the quality of the product is good. was been using for 1 year.not benefits. i dont like this product at all. silicon material of this one is very hard as compared to menstrual cup by strong or see safe. i just buy it because it is transparent in color in m size but sadly now i will buy another one of different company. material is good but slightly rigid and seal is not tight. always a little leakage. i have been in constant fear how this product will be but i am very happy to have it. is i have some issue with my restoration and due to this i was having constant fear of strain. and as an office goes and hanging out with friends i feel left out on those days. but as soon as i know about it i have thought to try this gynocup which is very comfortable and soft.nnot comes with small little pink packing and the package is itself very pretty with a small satin ribbon in it. inside the package it has a cleaner and also a pouch to keep it. everything is very well explained and the instruction is inside the box.ntrust this when you start using it you will see the difference in your life and that too without harming the mother nature as you will not wasting any pads or tampons which is not good for the nature at all.nthe self life is 10 years and the amount of pads and tampons in these years is so huge so its a pocket friendly product too. good cup with a long stem. good option for people with high croix but not a fan of the protruding rim and the material is also not contest. unfortunately maybe due the material or the rim it pushes up against my urethra a little making it not completely comfortable. one of the best things i like about cups is that once you put them in you can just forget about it but not with this. first one didn t fit well because of size issue. hence we contracted them and they replaced the item under their replacement policy. his surely is a great product if awareness is made among the feminine society to use it.no too was apprehensive on using it as we live on other products during this time cycle.but when i read how to use it and the benefits it have i thought of trying it and believe me it is a real helpful thing.not saved me of the usual looking back and uncomfortable feeling that i liked very much.the packing too was great as the product came in a paper bag with hand sanitizer to maintain hygienic issues.overall a great product i love this product. helps me especially during long days and this is a best way if you have problems with rashes and others. great purchase with this review i want to clear the misconception around using a menstrual cup. yes its very safe and very convenient to use. to u need to remove it everytime you see. the cup is designed to the thickness that offers comfort and is soft around your track. i only wish i started using it much much earlier but its va too late. by second month of using this. i have used a different brand of menstrual cup for more than 2 years now and since i had found some discoloration in my first cup i decided to change to a new one. i must say the no cup is a significant improvement over the first one. it is very soft and much easier to insert and has greater capacity so that i can keep it on for unto about 5 8 hours even on my first 2 days if correctly inserted. by previous cup used to leak in about 3 hours on my first two days. it was an awesome product and the packing was good and also worth every penny hello friends i am using this gynocup from past 2 month. i have tried several menstrual cups. but girls i tell you that this no cup is far more better than the other menstrual cups the cup is made from high grade silicone and it s really very soft and flexible you can easily use this and it s also very comfortable and very light weight the quality of cup is very good and also i have all sizes of theme small medium and large. to girls least go ve it a try this no cup.:smiling face with smiling eyes::smiling face with smiling eyes: his cup is soft and comfortable. back includes a sanitizer to clean the cup. his is a useful product to maintain hygienic during periods. it also reduces the possibilities of skin rashes caused due to sanitary pads. the only problem with this cup is that it is a little big for medium

these past two months with the up. i seriously forget i’m wearing the cup and this coming from someone who could hardly stand the pretext sized tampons. his allows your body to do its own thing how it

me i’m using menstrual cup from last 2 years and everytime i order from different bands. i liked their packing but the cup is very very hard it is coming out again and again putting too much pressure down and also the string is too big. overall in disappointed for the first time with a menstrual cup. i was really scared to try out the menstrual cup. by best friend had gifted me the ‘namyaa ultra soft reusable menstrual up’ which made me try out the menstrual cup. yes i was extremely scared to start using it but with the first usage itself it felt so comfortable and it was so soft that i hardly could feel that i was wearing a menstrual cup. generally i tend to stain my clothes during periods but since the time i have often for the switch to menstrual cup i found that there were no longer any kind of periods stains to be precise. his menstrual cup indeed sits comfortably in the vagina and can be worn for 12 consecutive hours. i have also bought the ‘namyaa disinfecting menstrual up wash’ for ensuring the best hygienic and it helps keep the cup and my intimate area clean for the matter. trying out the namyaa ultra soft reliable menstrual cup was one of the best decisions of my life as it makes for an economical drive as well that has helped me save a lot of money that i used to spend buying sanitary napkins every month. i always wanted to try menstrual cup got my hands on

irritation hygienic products of you re in a dilemma whether to take it or not just go for it in one word best . well choosing a cup for the st time for individual with no idea of anything scavenging through reviews feedback was quit frustration. without over thinking anymore ordered this one. honestly one of the best decisions of my life the cycle has never been this simple easy. a few days of practice in one cycle referring to online available information is great to go i switched to menstrual cup 3 years back and it s a game changes. namyaa cup is very soft made of silicons and i use

that you are menstruating the product is non returnanable. i ordered medium size cup. but that was too large than expected . i haven t opened the covering. i asked them for replacement of the same with a small one. but haven t got. i think small size is enough for everyone. i m married and have high bleeding in my periods. order this item only after deciding or size. its a best product with low price . i got it in offer and included cup wash. packing is best.i bought high prices other brand also but it s the same quality with very low price use very simple. and helpful for travelling .price is high but very nice. bigger than expected for medium. i am 28 and medium was a little large for me. very girl should buy this if they want get rid odor itching or leaking palm this is best product his cup is indeed ultrasoft as the name says. that is the reason why i chose this cup. but it is a bane and a boon co ultrasoftness means easier to insert but difficult to open up. during my first cycle with the cup i found it really hard to get it open up fully as it was staying squeezed inside. i even thought of getting another cup. but trust me all it takes is a ll bit of patience and practice.i mastered the method of how to get it opened properly during my second cycle and my periods is just wow since then up is extremely comfortable in every other manner other than the issue mentioned above. to for it. and dear girls don t give up until you master the art. : very bad product the cup’s material is thick and not soft then rim of the cup is also very thick and that make it difficult and painful to insert and remove the cup. i don’t recommend this product to anyone it s a great cup for beginners but i needed a firmer cup because the suction was not enough cut i m very active and sport person but i lui to use it over night or if i m going to be at home it s a bit harder to get it open at first i would recommend trying some folds that have manual opening but removing it is very easyno did happen to have to cut the stem a bit cut it was longer for me and also the stem doesn t has grip rings so it is a bit harder to pull out at first but after some getting used to its fine of you are someone with strong pelvic floor this cup is not for you least for beginners . it doesn t pop open inside. of you exercise daily or do intense physical activities chances are that your pelvic muscles are strong. his prevents the cup from opening inside your vagina. but i ve seen some youtubers who travel and tree use this so i think it s just because they re not new to cups. i ve done some research and my suggestion for beginners is to go for firmer cups that require less or no maneuvering to get the cup pop open inside. the quality packing and everything else about it was great. it just didn t work for me. am a beginner and used cups for 3 cycle. between skinny to medium built and medium flow. i had used 2 cup a hard one and this soft cup. advantage is this cup really super easy to insert unlike stiffen cups. i had leads for the overnight usage for small size cup. his again depends on your flow. i have medium flow and it count hold on for more than 6 his. but i would say this cup is highly recommended for those who are trying for the first time and yet to learn how to insert or find the right cup size. his was the first time that i tried menstural cup. i had always been using pads but they give rashes. i was skeptically to use it for the first time but it was so convenient. i will never use pads again.nnest thing they are reliable i liked the product .but be careful while selecting sizen. is in a married women i gone for medium.eventhough product was good but size looked big with length.which is very uncomfortable.nut my sister bought small size which is super good with size looks like medium of majority company and material very soft :ok hand:.nno i prefer small size:smiling face with open hands:no order small size liked it one year before i already bought the medium size of the same product that material was very good and comfortable. but this material is very hard and painful to use.i am disappointed with the purchase of this product.:thumbs down::thumbs down::thumbs down::thumbs down::thumbs down:i do not recommend it to anyone . i m a teenager 14 and was excited to use it for the first time .inserting it was a not a big deal for the first time but getting out gives a strange pain but my experience was good though the rim gave me a lot of pain and discomfort.though if u trim the rim into the right size without leaving any sharp edges its good for u boy u won t feel it at all. it s very soft easy to insert and easy for removal very comfortable but it doesn t fulfill the purpose it won t open vagina. it s too soft doesn t have grip and i tried days it always leads and won t open even if you ll try for an hour. to it s not a good product definitely not recommended its very comfortable.when i used this first time it is very difficult to insert.may be b/s of my fear.after that i had seen many video regarding this cups and surprisingly the second day i can easily inserted this.i suggest all ladies should buy this .i bought medium size but i think small is enough for the first time.i m 31yrs 4.8 height two c section.and day heavy flow.then also i suggest u to buy small. i bought 3 of these products but the last one came and disappointed me. up washing is in a small bottle the small cup is suggested for women withna low croix. however even for a small size the cup is too long. the problem with v shaped cups is that its diameter is less but height is too long. even after trimming the stem off it was a very uncomfortable experience. definitely not a cup for women with lower croix as it reaches all the way up till the croix and causes pain. also the cup is very very soft which is a task to open. for a medium or larger size the softness is okay but for small the cup becomes very difficult to open up inside you. cried for 2 cycle and eventually gave up. twitched to the of size of peesafe menstrual cup. it s broader as its bell shaped and is not very soft so it pop opens easily. west soft cup. to for it without a second thought. the size is not comfortable for methe product is good cry smaller size than usual.the cup doesn t pop open one inserted. you just fold it lengthwise and insert it. that s it they are very important for our us it helped me in so many ways and made my days easy i ordered it and it is light pink color. i got dark pink. right pink is a little bit soft. but dark pink is a little hard. i wanted it to be soft.:anxious face with sweat::anxious face with sweat: stem of cup should have a rounded/curved/soft edge. his cup had a straight cut edge which hurt a lot. besides the dimensions were perfect :thumbs up light skin tone: i have been using a menstrual cup user for over 2 years competition brand not namyaa and on a recent trip to delhi i realised i hadn t carried my cup so i ended up ordering namyaa cup as same day delivery delivery was available .nthe cup was a huge disappointment its way too soft doesn pop open inside the vagina and doesn have suction power. i love this product it’s give me a confidence it is the worst cup out there and i got black stains on cup it s surface was rough and i don t think it is made of medical grade silicon.no started with anger cup. though it was good initially later it started leaking. also anger was made in china and i doubted the quality of cup. i then bought crimson middle size cup which was sold by same manufacturers who sold safe cup now. they wrote fda complaint and all so i thought it would be good. however after delivery of cup made in china was written. now it shattered my belief. but i anyway used that cup and it also leads.now all cups out there are made in china like iron etc. i wanted to go for a cup made in india so after good reviews i decided to buy namyaa cup and let me tell you it is the worst cup.not s material is very thin and it just doesn t pop up inside vagina. it s small size is very small and there were black stains on pink cup which tells that it is not hygienic. now my money has been wasted because these are non returnable items. very disappointed up it s good for the beginners.new 17 n virgin i used it for the ist time.no for it.will cause a little pain in insertion n removing.not that s ok.practice makes u perfect.neck i ordered large cup. wont know right or wrong. facing difficulty to insert. age 31 and have delivered a baby. :slightly frowning face: no option to return and try another.first experiencegood thing is that i was expecting only cup. it there was a free disinfectant liquid also. the product is extra soft and light wait. but the main problem is it is not pop up. i tried clot of ways to insert it. to method is useful. already i used menstural cup of other company. but it was mistaken dropped in toilet. to i find this product from rating. it is not hoped up inside. to no use. finally i throw namyaa menstural cup in to trash. by money wasted. never buy this product. to for other company for me i need to empty every four to five hours i think i sad go for large one. west part is no wet pads no irritation. just inserting is bit painful. still best to switch it it s really really so soft and very easy to insert it without any pain. for the beginners it s the best option. you might face with leakage issues but once you master the skill it ll not be the problem anymore. must go with it without any second thought and say goodby to sanitary napkins new user here. used it for just one cycle. to far so good. to irritation no stress of leaking no odor. insertion and removal is a bit difficult. it is soft and a good product. but. its not work to me. i tried out various methods to insert the cup. but it not opens inside true to its description its soft and easy to insert. forms the suction and is comfortable from the word go. the only thing i wanted was it to be colourless. but apart from that i m fully satisfied with this indian made product.of anyone is going to try for first time. this is best i wanted to stop using pads so i was in search of these types of cups. i bought it reading the reviews. i used it didn t like it at all. yes it s soft easy to use but it doesn t open everytime you insert it resulting in staining your parties. it s comfortable to use only if it opens up properly. it doesn t have holes under the rim so it doesn t create the vacuum inside to help it stay intact. i bought 2 cups of 2 separate companies 1 this 1 of warmest. the other one that i bought is wonderful has holes so creates vacuum stays intact hence i can say the difference between the two. i would not recommend this one. the company needs to work on the quality of this cup. i ordered the large size.but i think medium size is enough for after delay also.first it s difficult to use.but when we know the technique it will be so easy to use.just find which way is better for u product is soft but for removing there is no grip. very nice product. soft and flexible cup. great for first time users. also includes a cloth pouch and a disinfectant cup wash. his is a worst brand menstrualcup is not opening inside his is my first menstruational cup and i had used this 3/4 cycle of my periods. it is not opening properly. i had tried clot by changing the size of the cup and by trying clot to keep in inside properly but not donna work. that i felt from my experience is this cup is too soft may be because of this is very difficult to open. even since it is soft it used slip off can t turn with term whirling adjusting. i don t recommend this. only the thing this is so soft.you will get any stiffness or irritation when u are putting. the stem does not have grooves/aims so the fingers keep slipping and the stem has sharp edges which hurt a lot. the rim want perfectly smooth. i really dont recommend buying this. there are better option his is took soft doesn t stay in its place. lips out of the vagina when you keep or legs wide open slips out if you walk. now you expect to use this . i tried using it couple of times and got tired of it. going to throw it in sustain for sure. very thin and comfortable product i haven t used it yet. its so soft. seems good. also received free cup wash. i ll update the review after i use it. ought it for 380. i hardly used this cup for 5 months and the stem has been broken all of a sudden. initially i liked the product as it is supersoft. but later i found a problem that it s not opening inside the vagina. and it makes our hard time more hard. on t recommend this brand. received a damaged product. the rim has a notch that s poking. finishing of it is also not good.nan t return it. may have to order another one because this time it s waste of money. i m 21 year old and a beginner for using menstrual cup.it s soft comfortable at the same time.i m so glad that i finally started using a menstrual cup. i m so in love with it that i regret not using a menstrual cup for past few years.i wish i would have started using it earlier its makes you colourless tension free periods like good cup for comfortable periods. but if you are using it for the first time pus buy small. i bought medium it s not big for me and i am going to buy a small one. and free wash is an advantage of this brand. i liked it . it is comfortable. its really soft superb fr beginners.size s is perfect for everyone with not too heavy flow .easy to use.would recommend for sure.also one tip.dont cut the tip until u r sure of its size as it takes few days to figure it out always the best one. real ultra soft. begginers can go for this without the second thought amazing product. it s the contest menstrual cup available in the market. to easy to insert and use. a very nice cup wash is also available in the package. i very well recommend it. happy periods. it is very hard to pop open as it is very soft. it gets stuck and leads too. i have tried it for the first time.i was very spectacle of using menstrual cup for the first time.but the quality of cup is so good and comfortable to you.i am satisfied with my purchase.thank you namyaa and amazon for fast delivery. his cup is very soft and easy to use. it is very nice for beginners. its so flexible to fold and can give protection for unto 12hrs. very nice product. i will suggest this menstural cup to all my closed ones. the cup is very soft hence easy to insert even for a beginner like me the product is same as shown in the pick. of you are having any doubts trust me and just go for it. you will not regret your decision must go for it i had issues inserting couple of days the tried other shapes of inserting seeing youtube video and finally it worked on t think just move to cups and had happy periods just like me:smiling face with smiling eyes: a better replacement of sanitary pads very good product. it s a game changes:smiling face with heart eyes: i would recommend it to every woman. please switch to menstrual cups. it s good for your health as well as the environment. i bought the small size as i m a begging.the cup gets inserted very easily co it s very soft and very small.but the cup is too soft that it literally can t open inside you.it remains in the folded post itself co it s too soft to have the power to unfold inside u.guess this brand is only for people with weak pelvic floor muscles.not recommended for tens and adults with average or strong pelvic muscles.only satisfaction was the free menstrual cup wash that came along with it.didn t expect that. amazing menstrual cup and it s best for beginners. it doesn t feel that something is inside. within few attempts it can get practiced. due to ultra softness it s little bit tough to open up else its a great product. comfortable but not meant for exercise you outdoor activities because of smoothness good packing loved it u also get a free namyaa hygienic wash. didn know that before. because of that i already brought a namyaa wash. overall it s really good and hygienic its must buy product am first time using menstrual cup and i loved it very comfortable once you use menstrual cup then you never go back to sanitary pads:smiling face: up is soft but it has been written not to be used if you have no sexual experience it is so soft it doesn t open up beginners don t buy this others it would be okay the stem is a bit more long i think so . product quality is awesome. but it s so soft that it remains folded inside. i tried at least 20 times and out of it the cup opened up only 3 4 times. to i had to switch to other brand. lip of the cup is very hard and discomfertable it s damage my skin can u please change the tip of this cup design it s not comfortable the time of removing it s like fluffy is a beginner after looking around for a reliable menstrual cup i bought this cup from namyaa and i am so happy with the purchase. it is great quality comes with a wash as well highly recommended. i am using menstrual cups for more than 2 year but this is worst it s end is too poky and it s way to soft to pop open i struggled clot and still it was leaking it was fold inside and couldn t open

one attempt. to the circus goes on until you have got it thoroughly right. of inserted wrongly then you have hell lot of trouble with all the blood spelling onto your clothes. his can be very frustration.nhis product is fairly good to use at home only. usually offices colleges and other public toilets don t have the facility to wash the cup outside the final. you can t remove the cup in the lavater and run to an outside sink wash it thoroughly and rush back to the lavater to insert again.nthe whole process of removal washing and re inserting is a time consuming process compared to

rolling eyes:. its my very first time using a menstrual cup and i chose this one co it says that its the contest cup ever but it is not; the rim and upper part if the cup is a bit hard.and it smells like later rubber however; the experience was very good i tried the cup before my period arrived 2 3 times to practice all the mechanism it wasn t easy at st time but it in went and time but nothing but half demand fold worked for me. when my period arrived i could easily use it but in still learning it will take time to use it with zero efforts. but;ones it is in it feels like nothing is there.and from the very first day i used it i did not leak at all not a single spot i never felt so comfortable on my periods. i am happy with the decision of twitching to menstrual cup. :grinning face with smiling eyes:now i am recommending it to every woman around me:slightly smiling face: my tip to begging is to practice until u get it right when or not on your period so u could use it without much efforts while your period. trust me you ll never want to go back to pads again :smiling face::smiling face:its a revolution for all the ladies i love other caries products. therefore bought this one when i wanted to make the switch. were’s my review:nlikes:nextremely good for first time users who are scared of inserting something into their vagina. the cup is extremely soft and can be folded with almost zero effortneasy extraction owing to it’s softness and a long tail/ stemnsize is relatively smaller than other bands and therefore the feeling of “ nothing “ is quite highnnone:nnot much softness is not apt for a good seal . it pills if you pinch the cup while removingnthe stem is too long for those who are used to cups or even tampons i being the latter . it kind sticks outnit smaller than what you would expect from a medium size cupnwas leakage issuesnoverall a great one for the first time users of insertion method period product. in my opinion it is even less invasion than a campan and easy to use. it loses it’s elasticity after a few use and refuses to seal well. the stem would require trimming for women with low or medium croix height. but it is a great product if you have never used anything other than pads and want to learn/ get used to how cups work its cool.i liked it.up i do recommend this cup to all first time users. but it completely depends on your use if you d find it comfortable or not.nlips:n compulsorily sanitize the cup first using normal soap or intimate wash and then put it in boiling water water for 2 minutes.n deep your nails clean and preferably trimmed least while using it for the first time. very important n of you experience any difficulty while placing the cup for the first 2 3 attempts. take a break for 15 20 minutes and then try again.n cry to find a clear looking cup as you can t be completely assured about the eyes that have been used with the silicon.n you might find cheaper cups but i would recommend to buy a mid ranged one for a good first time experience.n buying cheaper ones can lead to leads or discomfort making the overall experience not so good and might get you away from using menstrual cups again.n his cup comes with a pouch which is a 1 but doesn t have a container along. of possible store it in a container to avoid any damages to the cup.nn based on the experiences of my known people the size recommendations can be:n•early teenager: smalln•adult teenager:n sexually active / overnight : mediumn sexually inactive / underweight : smalln•women in 20 s not given birth vaginal n any body size : mediumnnon: needs a more sturdy and travel friendly packing/container ladies go for it it is used for life save now.very easy to use and clean yes indeed menstrual cups are boon to us women. you are odorless during your period. you can roam like a free bird. you won t feel that you are on your period. the thing here is the insertion and taking out process. you can t insert it in one go. i as a beginner tried so many times and finally made it. now inserting it is not a tension for me. now how to take it out well this is painful. the pressure created inside will not let it out. and it unfold while taking it out and it hurts. i still am struggling how to remove it painlessly. and regarding using sanitary pads you have to use it when you are on your rd day of period. cups are good for heavy flow days but when it is nearer to its end pads are must. i also don t think it is a good replacement of pads as it is not easy use it takes time. love this product so much fun of my

my clothes anything like that i love it i have been using menstrual cups for 7 years. such a waste product which i bought in these years. not sturdy it s so flexible so it don t get open . quality is good just the size is small and is more suitable for 24 years and below girls having low to medium flow. not recommended for heavy flow.also it creates a strong vacuum which sometimes is difficult to break and pull out.overall its comfortable. take your time to figure out a comfortable fold and insert it similarly to a campan .not wouldn’t have to face any leakage if you make sure that the cup has full opened up .no slight pinch at the bottom with a swift motion would be the easiest and quickest way of removal .no what makes you feel the most comfortable . most of all relax .nnon certain rare occasions wherein i kept the cup longer than i intended to i have experienced sporting due to heavy flow this doesn’t have to be a necessary one but party liners always come in help.letter safe than sorry.noverall all about the productn very neat packing.n comes in a cut little bag .n sturdy .n well defined instructions. i believe twitching from pads to mental cup has been a great decision. it

that some cups are just not meant for some bodies hence i m willing to try.nether than that the cup is packed very well comes with a little bag and instructions sheet loved the aesthetic the steam steriliser does its job well. there s a measuring cup and a cloth provided. i just didn t like that the lid of the steriliser doesn t lock properly. have been using this for a while now. this is my first cup and let me tell you think no further just get it. no leads no infection no pads .never knew periods could be this fun.my life changed for good after started using this. very convenient while

definitely an innovation for female . mustard try and must have in your period vanity box. i recently made a sustainable switch from the old itchy sanitary pads to menstrual cups. being a first time user i was extremely scared and it took me a few months to convince myself but here i am wondering why i didn t make this switch earlier no did my fair bit of research on cups before deciding to buy the warmest m sized cup and it was the best decision not took me a few tries to well put it in but once you figure out what works best for you this cup works like a charm. to leads no staining and absolutely no discomfort. the cup is super soft and easy to insert. opens up pretty easily and its super easy too remove it as well. didn t need to cut the stem.ney friend who previously used cups from presage she said they were too tough switched to caries and she too loves how soft it is. easy to use . it s good also . after using this product in vagina no problem no rashes in this product specified know clergy not a problem it s good. actually after 1 year i am giving this product review i don t know how to give review also so now i came to know so right now i am giving this love you but product is become now old okay i will take one pick. many times i will give rating i don t know how to give review also only so long time anyway the product thank you take sure to take the right size cup we will only get to know if we use it once boy as the guideline mentioned am supposed to take large as i had a vaginal delivery but for me it’s too large and not at all comfortable as i could sense little discomfort and have purchased medium one which fits properly and it almost makes me feel that am not on my periods.north buying and must try. received the caries menstrual cup in the size small in a perfect condition. the cardboard comes with the cup a pouch and a detailed instruction leaflet.no ve been a cup vert for a while now and this brand looks promising hence went ahead and bought a small cup for light flow days. the cup is nearly 5 cm deep and has 4 holes punched towards the brim for suction break. the only concern i have is the stem being really long which might just spoke out and irritate. gros:not has a long stem so women with a tall croix can also go for this.the material is soft however the cup is quite firm. of you have a strong pelvis pelvic floor then this one is for you.not has good suction and feels absolutely comfortable after inserting.nnone:taking it out is tricky because of it s firm make however with little practice it gets easier.non heavy flow days there was very slight leakage. it could be that i couldn t get it right the first time.nnot s a wonderful product very comfortable and very unfordable too. it has no colour and no added perfume.nno made a switch to menstrual cups about a year ago and i ll never go back to using pads. of you d like to make a switch then please watch some youtube tutorials before purchasing a cup.good luck with lot of research got this cup.super comfortable after using for 2 3 times.nor first time users pus except initial leads this is because you may not be completely familiar with your anatomy. you can always wear a pad for safety.nut after using it for 2 cycle u become a pro in inserting and removing.non fact u can be aware if the cup is leaking may be due to improper insertion or the cup is not stationed completely . give it a try for 2 3 times until u become comfortable.worth it .wash free tension free nights colourless. i believe i found the best one. i have purchased the menstrual cups twice. but i felt the both of them were too hard to put it in. to matter you are a been or a lady who has the experience to deliver babies when you use a menstrual cup you have to practice it a couple of times. even though the item seems good it might feel painful. when i used this item for the first time i struggled with it and felt pain. after some time i am able to use it easily and i m feeling come as this item is very soft.non general we have to keep/maintain it cleaned and we should not continue to use it for more than 8 hours as per the instructions. he need to pay attention more rather than a pad. for a first time the idea of a menstrual cup scared me a lot but warmest definitely made life easier. not only did they respond to my queried on instagram and helped me pick the right size for me the overall experience of the product is beyond comparison.nmade with medially approved silicone the cup is my step forward to experience a sustainable period. once you fold and put it inside you do take a day to adjust to it. but then it is super easy to use and you need to simply take it out wash it and refuse afterwards again nnot also comes with a cut pouch for you to store it once you are done for the month ngreat quality and definitely value for money against all the money we spend on sanitary napkins nney pro tip: on’t be scared and try it writing this review from my husband s account as i had ordered from his prime account.not will take you 2 3 periods to learn the proper way to handle it. the size of the cup of perfect i found no issues with the length.no complaints about this product. i got this as it has no added color scent parades and it seemed like a genuine brand. give it a try nalso one you get used to using menstrual cup you will be grateful for using it and ask yourself why did you not take the leap before.imagine years of no pads during periods no rashes and freedom to swim exercise etc.very female should give a definite try a menstrual cup once in their life. his brand s cup is not leak proof and isn t soft. not at all recommended. i used this first time.its convenient to use but i feel a little bit discomfort as well.may be i used to this by cycle by cycle.nut the removal process is kind of mess so take your time to used to this menstrual cup i think this will become saviour for me and other girls also i was in search of a good menstrual cup since a long time now wanted to get rid of wearing pads. i came across this one. it first i was a bit sceptic but still bought it. is a st time user it felt little different for the st 2 days but later i got used to it. the holes below rim does the trick of creating vacuum the cup stays intact. to stains no discomfort. i used it at night too while sleeping so it was like 8 10 his probably still no stains. once you get hold to it it s pretty comfortable. i am glad i bought it. now no more sanitary waste. give it a try. on t get scared before using it give yourself some time to adjust to it. now in using strong cup s size so i ordered for my mon m size cup in caries after i notice it both same size and they mentioned in the box l size is for married and for who gave natural birth. i feel just to share my experience here. not complaining about anything :smiling face with smiling eyes: thanks vice product and very comfortable to use oh my god i m soon comfortable with caries. its so soft. easy to insert and remove. only issue i felt is that it is small in size. i was using care s sized sensual cup and ordered caries s m sized cup. it care s s is still bigger. to i have to clean it more frequent than i did it with care. to if u have heavy bleeding try l of caries.otherwise amazing quality. u can hardly feel it. thank you so much for this revolutionary product:smiling face with heart eyes: well i ordered this in small size but instead i got the medium one ink what s with the delivery. but the product is soft. the upper suction part is kind thick it was definitely hard to stuck it in and unfortunately due to that i want able to make any type of shapes for insertion. but give it a try:thumbs up medium light skin tone: his is great overall but i found it to be a bit harder than expected. to your research on whether you need a firm or softer cup. the suction was really strong which made it slightly harder to remove the first time. to if you re a beginner try finding a more flexible cup instead preferably with a ring instead of stem for removal. girls. all buy if you can use hard product. it s not soft at all. all don t use this . i am not a new user. am using cup from last 3 years. those who are using the cup for the first time. due to such a hard insertion and pulling out.you got the horrible experience. all use a soft cup . key girls let s get straight to the point. his product is an absolute masterpiece you can t doubt this as it s so comfortable and soft and glided with your body plus has no chemicals or eyes. i was scared about the size but everything went well i m so impressed with this product. by period ended without having even a single drop of blood stain on clothes. need to be cleaned after 8 9 he of usage and after insertion it doesn t even feel like you re even on your periods. west part is it s co friendly and easy on money. to buy this baby. excellent product every woman should start using. in beginning i was really scared and worried. by friends suggested me to buy the product and use. after i started using its very easy to use. one should be very relaxed while using this product if u r in hurry and if u don t insert properly it starts leaking. of u insert properly not even single drop of blood is seen. was be hygienic while using this. over all product is very soft and easy to use . top is hard and bottom of cup is very thin not properly fit and it leads to leaking lay videothe cup is in good quality but the very edge of the cup is too hard. it is difficult to use when the edges are too thick. was good fragrance. means menstrual cup and clears odour. compared to other cups somehow the fit of warmest’s cup is perfect. easily adjustable whereas i struggle with other brand pieces. probably it’s the perfect density/thickness of the cup that helps with the adjustment. i just feel it’s well need. its very comfortable to use but after many research i found that rarely any one get allergic with silicone products like 99 will comfortable in silicone use but 1 or people get allergic with silicone product am in that 1 :pleading face::crying face: so if you feel itching or pimples in vagina after some use of cup than stop using silicone made cups i am 25yr unmarried woman. i was using 1 cup for 3 month but after that it is unable to fit easily but this one is so good. his is getting inserted so easy and this is very soft in comparison to older one. i will suggest to buy this cup boy or it s softness and it s shape which makes it to open inside very easily. must try fantastic product.near ladies please try once i bet you love it.of you try once definitely you will say bye bye to sanitary pads napkins etc.nvery much comfortable.within 4 5 seconds you can wear.nut only thing that you should learn how to insert .their are many video in youtube just go through.that s all.nenjoy your period days without any irritation.his is 100 genuine feedback.nhappy periods. good for users its good but i think i would take more time to feel comfortable with these cups. very good product quality nice :thumbs up: west investment ever in the hygienic products. everything is really good but cup ka stem those bad had to uncomfortable lata had. i wish it could be smaller than its is now. take compare to other cups its much much better. for first time it feel little uncomfortable but from the day second of cycle itself just going with come level great. north buying. you can save a lot of money wasting on sanitary pads and minimizing social embarrassment due to need of changing pads. remember one thing before inserting on first day of period and after each cycle sterile the cup in boiling water for few minutes. met it dry n then use or store. his product is just dam product i will suggest for every woman. easy to use and no tension of leakage. but while sitting you feel it. but it will not irritate you. i like this product quality is very good packaging and the presentation was good. product is also comfortable.the instructions in it was really helpful. overall i m happy with the purchase :d it s not the same quality as it was a year back this is the second time i ordered the product which is very hard i didn t expect this type of quality in caries it got good market and immediately switched to provide a low quality like some other cheap companies please change the quality to as earlier before it went wrong not suitable for beginners. it is too firm and rim of cup is not smooth. its packing and everything has good quality but not at all comfortable with it. i have bought another cup because of it. and it is much better. it first i thought how can i use it what to do etc but after to use it becomes to easy to use and i like the product you should buy it its to good easy to use comfortable :smiling face with smiling eyes::smiling face with smiling eyes:i am very happy for using it and i had a pad free periods thank amazon i love the product i haven t tried any other product yet ink if it is like normal but you can feel this cup inside yourself and this kind hurts. it s not very easy to use initially have to keep trying to get the hang of it and the correct position. the stick is actually annoying it feels like it s hanging out. i had to cut it a bit to make it smaller. but surely there is no wet feeling and rush to change pads every now and then. it was my first period with a cup i guess i will get better with the insertion by the next. or i will test another brand. only thing is the mouth has little sharp edge there s no going back after using cups. start using cups girls sap without second thought. good for environment and for herself too so what else u need must go for it. i am not sure if i got an original one or just an old model because i got the product completely different from what is shown in the picture. in fact i only got a pouch to keep the cup and not the covered box which i saw many others got i ordered the size m. after using for a month and post washing and sterilizing it the colour changed from white to yellowish on t know how the quality of it is also i am changing it quite often as i am in my home. it feels like it is unable to hold much once office starts it will be difficult to re use outside. menstrual cups as a product takes time to re use and not very comfortable to change when you are outside. to it is preferable to use tampons or pads outside very soft. it might seem a bit difficult to use for the first time cup user like me but trust me in just 2 or 3 days you can get used to it. it is a great product for those who are beginners. it is soft and comes with a cut cotton bag. easy to use. vice product and size fits me well go for ithis is my first time i am using this and i love to use it after wearing it i feel my pad free periods completely satisfied:smiling face with smiling eyes: comfortable to use nice product feel free to go anywhere not soft it s hard it is my second menstrual cup.i lost my first cup in travelling.after that i bought warmest menstrual cup.i realised that it is more comfortable than the first one.it is very soft and easy to insist.a little bit smaller than the first one it is apt for me.i’m so happy.i’m using large size because of normal delivery . the product is amazing just a little issue. the stem of the cup is long which irritated your skin but once you cut it as per your requirement it is perfect to use. super easy to use. to 12 he protection.easy to clean and maintain. moved it :star struck: good mild no fragrance once the product insertion is well done it works well. the only problem with the cup is it s opening up to set well within the blood collection area. the cup takes a lot of time to open and adjust and till the time the witness and discomfort already sets in. i want to purchase single cup but there was no option hence i bought this pack and now when i am using this i feel that cup material is not soft.it is very painful when you remove as it is not soft. i am feeling pain when sitting and coughing. highly disappointed there is no option of refund.nnone year back i also purchased a single cup of same brand but that was very soft it feels like no cup i inserted but now they decreased their quality of material and even it feels slightly bigger than previous one. it s a very nice product for the first time users u feel a hectic task for insertion until or used to it. before pads was very irritating with the rashes order very uncomfortable but now it s a happy periods thanks to caries cups nd my friend who suggested me this cup. really soft and the long stem with bulb provide easy removal. proper procedure of insertion and removal will make you fall in love with

was a bit easy for me but i felt little difficult to take it out but was not very bad. i really enjoyed using cup for 2 days but was a bit conscious since it s my first usage and along with this i also used presage cloth pads as i totally wanted to avoid using other pads as the number of pads that i am using per cycle frightened me. i am definitely going to try mental cup in other cycle and

me i’m using menstrual cup from last 2 years and everytime i order from different bands. i liked their packing but the cup is very very hard it is coming out again and again putting too much pressure

longer any kind of periods stains to be precise. his menstrual cup indeed sits comfortably in the vagina and can be worn for 12 consecutive hours. i have also bought the ‘namyaa disinfecting menstrual

also flexible. ve given birth and medium size is so good for me. no more nasty periods adjusting pad etc.insert it and forget that or on periods for the next 8 hours :face with tongue: you will forget that you are menstruating the product is non returnanable. i ordered medium size cup. but that was too large than expected . i haven t opened the covering. i asked them for replacement of the same with a small one. but haven t got. i think small size is enough for everyone. i m married and have high bleeding in my periods. order this item only after deciding or size. its a best product with low price . i got it in offer and included cup wash. packing is best.i bought high prices other brand also but it s the same quality with very low price use very simple. and helpful for travelling .price is high but very nice. bigger than expected for medium. i am 28 and medium was a little large for me. very girl should buy this if they want get rid odor itching or leaking palm this is best product his cup is indeed ultrasoft as the name says. that is the reason why i chose this cup. but it is a bane and a boon co ultrasoftness means easier to insert but difficult to open up. during my first cycle with the cup i found it really hard to get it open up fully as it was staying squeezed inside. i even thought of getting another cup. but trust me all it takes is a ll bit of patience and practice.i mastered the method of how to get it opened properly during my second cycle and my periods is just wow since then up is extremely comfortable in every other manner other than the issue mentioned above. to for it. and dear girls don t give up until you master the art. : very bad product the cup’s material is thick and not soft then rim of the cup is also very thick and that make it difficult and painful to insert and remove the cup. i don’t recommend this product to anyone it s a great cup for beginners but i needed a firmer cup because the suction was not enough cut i m very active and sport person but i lui to use it over night or if i m going to be at home it s a bit harder to get it open at first i would recommend trying some folds that have manual opening but removing it is very easyno did happen to have to cut the stem a bit cut it was longer for me and also the stem doesn t has grip rings so it is a bit harder to pull out at first but after some getting used to its fine of you are someone with strong pelvic floor this cup is not for you least for beginners . it doesn t pop open inside. of you exercise daily or do intense physical activities chances are that your pelvic muscles are strong. his prevents the cup from opening inside your vagina. but i ve seen some youtubers who travel and tree use this so i think it s just because they re not new to cups. i ve done some research and my suggestion for beginners is to go for firmer cups that require less or no maneuvering to get the cup pop open inside. the quality packing and everything else about it was great. it just didn t work for me. am a beginner and used cups for 3 cycle. between skinny to medium built and medium flow. i had used 2 cup a hard one and this soft cup. advantage is this cup really super easy to insert unlike stiffen cups. i had leads for the overnight usage for small size cup. his again depends on your flow. i have medium flow and it count hold on for more than 6 his. but i would say this cup is highly recommended for those who are trying for the first time and yet to learn how to insert or find the right cup size. his was the first time that i tried menstural cup. i had always been using pads but they give rashes. i was skeptically to use it for the first time but it was so convenient. i will never use pads again.nnest thing they are reliable i liked the product .but be careful while selecting sizen. is in a married women i gone for medium.eventhough product was good but size looked big with length.which is very uncomfortable.nut my sister bought small size which is super good with size looks like medium of majority company and material very soft :ok hand:.nno i prefer small size:smiling face with open hands:no order small size liked it one year before i already bought the medium size of the same product that material was very good and comfortable. but this material is very hard and painful to use.i am disappointed with the purchase of this product.:thumbs down::thumbs down::thumbs down::thumbs down::thumbs down:i do not recommend it to anyone . i m a teenager 14 and was excited to use it for the first time .inserting it was a not a big deal for the first time but getting out gives a strange pain but my experience was good though the rim gave me a lot of pain and discomfort.though if u trim the rim into the right size without leaving any sharp edges its good for u boy u won t feel it at all. it s very soft easy to insert and easy for removal very comfortable but it doesn t fulfill the purpose it won t open vagina. it s too soft doesn t have grip and i tried days it always leads and won t open even if you ll try for an hour. to it s not a good product definitely not recommended its very comfortable.when i used this first time it is very difficult to insert.may be b/s of my fear.after that i had seen many video regarding this cups and surprisingly the second day i can easily inserted this.i suggest all ladies should buy this .i bought medium size but i think small is enough for the first time.i m 31yrs 4.8 height two c section.and day heavy flow.then also i suggest u to buy small. i bought 3 of these products but the last one came and disappointed me. up washing is in a small bottle the small cup is suggested for women withna low croix. however even for a small size the cup is too long. the problem with v shaped cups is that its diameter is less but height is too long. even after trimming the stem off it was a very uncomfortable experience. definitely not a cup for women with lower croix as it reaches all the way up till the croix and causes pain. also the cup is very very soft which is a task to open. for a medium or larger size the softness is okay but for small the cup becomes very difficult to open up inside you. cried for 2 cycle and eventually gave up. twitched to the of size of peesafe menstrual cup. it s broader as its bell shaped and is not very soft so it pop opens easily. west soft cup. to for it without a second thought. the size is not comfortable for methe product is good cry smaller size than usual.the cup doesn t pop open one inserted. you just fold it lengthwise and insert it. that s it they are very important for our us it helped me in so many ways and made my days easy i ordered it and it is light pink color. i got dark pink. right pink is a little bit soft. but dark pink is a little hard. i wanted it to be soft.:anxious face with sweat::anxious face with sweat: stem of cup should have a rounded/curved/soft edge. his cup had a straight cut edge which hurt a lot. besides the dimensions were perfect :thumbs up light skin tone: i have been using a menstrual cup user for over 2 years competition brand not namyaa and on a recent trip to delhi i realised i hadn t carried my cup so i ended up ordering namyaa cup as same day delivery delivery was available .nthe cup was a huge disappointment its way too soft doesn pop open inside the vagina and doesn have suction power. i love this product it’s give me a confidence it is the worst cup out there and i got black stains on cup it s surface was rough and i don t think it is made of medical grade silicon.no started with anger cup. though it was good initially later it started leaking. also anger was made in china and i doubted the quality of cup. i then bought crimson middle size cup which was sold by same manufacturers who sold safe cup now. they wrote fda complaint and all so i thought it would be good. however after delivery of cup made in china was written. now it shattered my belief. but i anyway used that cup and it also leads.now all cups out there are made in china like iron etc. i wanted to go for a cup made in india so after good reviews i decided to buy namyaa cup and let me tell you it is the worst cup.not s material is very thin and it just doesn t pop up inside vagina. it s small size is very small and there were black stains on pink cup which tells that it is not hygienic. now my money has been wasted because these are non returnable items. very disappointed up it s good for the beginners.new 17 n virgin i used it for the ist time.no for it.will cause a little pain in insertion n removing.not that s ok.practice makes u perfect.neck i ordered large cup. wont know right or wrong. facing difficulty to insert. age 31 and have delivered a baby. :slightly frowning face: no option to return and try another.first experiencegood thing is that i was expecting only cup. it there was a free disinfectant liquid also. the product is extra soft and light wait. but the main problem is it is not pop up. i tried clot of ways to insert it. to method is useful. already i used menstural cup of other company. but it was mistaken dropped in toilet. to i find this product from rating. it is not hoped up inside. to no use. finally i throw namyaa menstural cup in to trash. by money wasted. never buy this product. to for other company for me i need to empty every four to five hours i think i sad go for large one. west part is no wet pads no irritation. just inserting is bit painful. still best to switch it it s really really so soft and very easy to insert it without any pain. for the beginners it s the best option. you might face with leakage issues but once you master the skill it ll not be the problem anymore. must go with it without any second thought and say goodby to sanitary napkins new user here. used it for just one cycle. to far so good. to irritation no stress of leaking no odor. insertion and removal is a bit difficult. it is soft and a good product. but. its not work to me. i tried out various methods to insert the cup. but it not opens inside true to its description its soft and easy to insert. forms the suction and is comfortable from the word go. the only thing i wanted was it to be colourless. but apart from that i m fully satisfied with this indian made product.of anyone is going to try for first time. this is best i wanted to stop using pads so i was in search of these types of cups. i bought it reading the reviews. i used it didn t like it at all. yes it s soft easy to use but it doesn t open everytime you insert it resulting in staining your parties. it s comfortable to use only if it opens up properly. it doesn t have holes under the rim so it doesn t create the vacuum inside to help it stay intact. i bought 2 cups of 2 separate companies 1 this 1 of warmest. the other one that i bought is wonderful has holes so creates vacuum stays intact hence i can say the difference between the two. i would not recommend this one. the company needs to work on the quality of this cup. i ordered the large size.but i think medium size is enough for after delay also.first it s difficult to use.but when we know the technique it will be so easy to use.just find which way is better for u product is soft but for removing there is no grip. very nice product. soft and flexible cup. great for first time users. also includes a cloth pouch and a disinfectant cup wash. his is a worst brand menstrualcup is not opening inside his is my first menstruational cup and i had used this 3/4 cycle of my periods. it is not opening properly. i had tried clot by changing the size of the cup and by trying clot to keep in inside properly but not donna work. that i felt from my experience is this cup is too soft may be because of this is very difficult to open. even since it is soft it used slip off can t turn with term whirling adjusting. i don t recommend this. only the thing this is so soft.you will get any stiffness or irritation when u are putting. the stem does not have grooves/aims so the fingers keep slipping and the stem has sharp edges which hurt a lot. the rim want perfectly smooth. i really dont recommend buying this. there are better option his is took soft doesn t stay in its place. lips out of the vagina when you keep or legs wide open slips out if you walk. now you expect to use this . i tried using it couple of times and got tired of it. going to throw it in sustain for sure. very thin and comfortable product i haven t used it yet. its so soft. seems good. also received free cup wash. i ll update the review after i use it. ought it for 380. i hardly used this cup for 5 months and the stem has been broken all of a sudden. initially i liked the product as it is supersoft. but later i found a problem that it s not opening inside the vagina. and it makes our hard time more hard. on t recommend this brand. received a damaged product. the rim has a notch that s poking. finishing of it is also not good.nan t return it. may have to order another one because this time it s waste of money. i m 21 year old and a beginner for using menstrual cup.it s soft comfortable at the same time.i m so glad that i finally started using a menstrual cup. i m so in love with it that i regret not using a menstrual cup for past few years.i wish i would have started using it earlier its makes you colourless tension free periods like good cup for comfortable periods. but if you are using it for the first time pus buy small. i bought medium it s not big for me and i am going to buy a small one. and free wash is an advantage of this brand. i liked it . it is comfortable. its really soft superb fr beginners.size s is perfect for everyone with not too heavy flow .easy to use.would recommend for sure.also one tip.dont cut the tip until u r sure of its size as it takes few days to figure it out always the best one. real ultra soft. begginers can go for this without the second thought amazing product. it s the contest menstrual cup available in the market. to easy to insert and use. a very nice cup wash is also available in the package. i very well recommend it. happy periods. it is very hard to pop open as it is very soft. it gets stuck and leads too. i have tried it for the first time.i was very spectacle of using menstrual cup for the first time.but the quality of cup is so good and comfortable to you.i am satisfied with my purchase.thank you namyaa and amazon for fast delivery. his cup is very soft and easy to use. it is very nice for beginners. its so flexible to fold and can give protection for unto 12hrs. very nice product. i will suggest this menstural cup to all my closed ones. the cup is very soft hence easy to insert even for a beginner like me the product is same as shown in the pick. of you are having any doubts trust me and just go for it. you will not regret your decision must go for it i had issues inserting couple of days the tried other shapes of inserting seeing youtube video and finally it worked on t think just move to cups and had happy periods just like me:smiling face with smiling eyes: a better replacement of sanitary pads very good product. it s a game changes:smiling face with heart eyes: i would recommend it to every woman. please switch to menstrual cups. it s good for your health as well as the environment. i bought the small size as i m a begging.the cup gets inserted very easily co it s very soft and very small.but the cup is too soft that it literally can t open inside you.it remains in the folded post itself co it s too soft to have the power to unfold inside u.guess this brand is only for people with weak pelvic floor muscles.not recommended for tens and adults with average or strong pelvic muscles.only satisfaction was the free menstrual cup wash that came along with it.didn t expect that. amazing menstrual cup and it s best for beginners. it doesn t feel that something is inside. within few attempts it can get practiced. due to ultra softness it s little bit tough to open up else its a great product. comfortable but not meant for exercise you outdoor activities because of smoothness good packing loved it u also get a free namyaa hygienic wash. didn know that before. because of that i already brought a namyaa wash. overall it s really good and hygienic its must buy product am first time using menstrual cup and i loved it very comfortable once you use menstrual cup then you never go back to sanitary pads:smiling face: up is soft but it has been written not to be used if you have no sexual experience it is so soft it doesn t open up beginners don t buy this others it would be okay the stem is a bit more long i think so . product quality is awesome. but it s so soft that it remains folded inside. i tried at least 20 times and out of it the cup opened up only 3 4 times. to i had to switch to other brand. lip of the cup is very hard and discomfertable it s damage my skin can u please change the tip of this cup design it s not comfortable the time of removing it s like fluffy is a beginner after looking around for a reliable menstrual cup i bought this cup from namyaa and i am so happy with the purchase. it is great quality comes with a wash as well highly recommended. i am using menstrual cups for more than 2 year but this is worst it s end is too poky and it s way to soft to pop open i struggled clot and still it was leaking it was fold inside and couldn t open

patches. north every rule since it makes period cramps tolerable without having to pop a pill. also used it when i had a mild pull in my back. always helpful for period cramps and sometimes backache too. though the sickness wears off just after one evening itself. i wish it lasted longer. his product is really effective and does what it claims and relieves pain. have been using it for more than a year and is very effective during menstrual pain not so effective. must a okay product. may be useful for person with mild pain. but not effective for severe cramps i never thought it would work so well. a very satisfying outcome. i have used these patches for my mon’s neck and knee pain and she got pain relief in approximately 45 minutes.no have ordered the product and i definitely recommend it. to relief in pain while using the patch i have been using the product during the first two days of periods. it gives a mild relief from the cramps. i found it better than the other pain relief strips available in the market. a single strip is effective for least 4 6 hours. his is a revolutionary product. why anybody else didn t think before to make something like this. women just buy this. it makes the severe period pain bearable and sometime even fade away. also it resolves floating and mastitis issue. i am someone who cannot even sit and walk properly on my first two days of period because of the severe pain. and wearing it i danced on my first day. to it s unbelievable.no won t say i didn t feel pain. but the thing is it s quite bearable and for me 6 hours were like just easy going. i wore it for 8 hours then i had to change for a good night sleep.no when you stick it for the first time on the effected area you will feel a cool singly sensation for few minutes which is because it release the oils which prevent you from pain. within an hour you will almost forget about the pain. it s easy to use you won t even feel it it s thin and easy to stick on your belly abdomen or back. it s also easy to remove. also if you want to remove it for sometime you can refuse it within its time limit. must keep it safe and do not let it loose it s adhesive. they gives relief but maybe it doesn t suits my body/skin co it left small small rash or something like dot dots. but maybe be it might be due to sweat. i have been using it since 4 5 years now. i have v bad menstrual cramps and i have to drive a 2 wheeler which makes it super uncomfortable and painful during those bump rides. it kind of gives you an extreme chilly feeling making the pain absolutely the same way the hot pack works. only difference is hot pack is warm and it’s cold but it lasts for 3 hours for me max. still much much better than sitting with a hot pack or pulling down mental. on t know whether it works or not. because even after using it i don t feel anything. pain relief for female good product for me these work like magic to reduce severe pain. the smell itself is extremely soothing. they won t make the pain go away completely.but gives immense relief. a great alternative to pain tillers.naive it a try to it does smell a little but the product is effective. i have been using this patch since last year for relief from menstrual pain mostly . the first two times i ordered the patch was very adhesive and it literally remains stuck to the body for over 12 hours if you want. however the last two times i ordered the patch barely sticks and keeps rolling off. i would agree that the ingredient in the patch do provide relief from the pain but for the price it is very expensive and not economical. given the ingredient and the overall product i believe there is a very high margin that the manufacturers have on this product. you could possibly get a roll on ball with menthol eucalyptus camphor that would last you longer as this patch is only a one time use. even though i like it i am disappointed with the price and i would not like to invest in it every month vice product but i guess the effect fades within days once the part is open. would recommend individual packing for each strip so that the effect stays when used each day. gives great mental support. it of actual pain relieved too. but if you experience more than mild backache then don t expect it to replace a painkiller. one of the best things i found to curb my period pain.i have tried all types of tears oil hot water bag.but nothing used to work for my severe cramps.finally i used to end up taking mental but i was worried co of side effects of popping pill every month.but this patches helped me lot to reduce the pain.though the pain doesn disappear fully but it reduces to a great level.previously i couldn get up from my bed co of severe pain.hope the quality remains the same i ve had crippling cramps all my life. i ve passed out from them a time or two. even heat pads only help to a certain extent. i ve had to take painkillers for at least 2 days every month since as far as i can remember. i ve tried the roll on electric pulses home remedies tears tissues and on one momentous occasion drugs other than painkillers. nothing had worked so far. until now.nno just got these yesterday on my first day. i stuck it over my use not expecting anything. but within 2 minutes cramps gone it was ridiculous i almost didn t believe it. i thought it was just a coincidence. but it happened again 12 hours later when i replied the next patch. cramps just. gone nno recommend every woman to try this at least once please. you ll thank me and you ll thank yourself for doing it good product :ok hand: the only issues if you keep this for one month then the adhesive is not as effective i used the patch for relief from lower back pain. trying to apply it myself was difficult because it is quite flies and tends to stick to itself. but effective over the period of one full day. i cut it to ensure coverage of the affected area on my back. worked well especially through the night. it first i wasn t really sure about purchasing this product at first place but after reading few article s about it thought to give it a try. by periods are painful on scale of 1 10 its 8. i was expecting the pain to go down to at least 6 but guess what to my surprise this patches absolutely worked. it tools down pain to 3 that i forgot i had one. satisfied and happy i will recommend to try these. i am a person with extreme periodic pain and have to take a lot of pills. his product really helped in reducing the pain. it didn take it away completely but helped me in reducing the intake of pills. i think it would work perfect for a person with average period pain. it is very easy to use and remove. not very sticky. but if u feel uncomfortable in removing the patch just apply some water. personally i think the effect lasts only for 6 7 his. right differ from person to person though. it stops my pain works great thank you i would have given this 5 starts had the adhesion been better. it doesn’t stick when there is sweat. there will obviously be sweat at the stomach and lower back area. but. i the product is a boon for ladies. i used it for lower back pain which i have been experiencing since last few years. it gave me relief from pain. the smell is of eucalyptus and has a soothing and relaxing effect. i would surely recommend it. i had calf pain due to muscle sprain and it gave me relief in that too.the only point for me is at the time of removal. it pulls hair and is a bit painful. to have to be extra careful at the time of removal from the skin. but this can t be considered as a negative point for this fantastic product. i really like this product. this actually helps in reducing the pain and cramps but something which i don t like is they say the stick around 11 12 hours but i find it hardly manage by 3 hours after then they loose their sickness .and around 4 hours they give you that cooling sensation which really helps you in your painful days. over all my experience is good not excellent.recommended to those women who really seeking something useful in their periods :clapping hands: the patch sticks well doesn protrude has a menthol like scent which i found ok but some might find strong. it worked well on days when i had low to medium period pain but had very little effect on days with heavy flow/pain. smells nice like tiger ball warm up the belly but the blue already a few times caused itching irritation on my skin which lasted for a week after i used it works like magic. seriously never expected it to be this good. i always get very severe cramps backpain during my periods. it was so hard that i can neither move or sleep.no m lucky i got this product. must stick it pain vanishes completely. even painkillers didn t work for me but this did helped a lot to study during exam.:ok hand:truly recommended more better than those side effect filled tablets.:heart suit:amazing product life changes for us girls.:dizzy: his is my husband s account. i had ordered this due to free delivery.noccasionally i too suffer from menstrual cramps and had to take pill even though i hated it.nut thanks to this product it is safe verbal and easy to use.nne just need to apply to the affected site and continue with our daily routine.no work so it is so easy to carry apply and relief without any side effects.nhighly recommend.no try. the product is good since i m a person who suffers much pain and it ultimately becomes unbearable. i had to buy this. his did provide relief from the pain but not completely. it gave a cooling sensation which countered the period pain. on t think that it will work like magic; it helps to an extent i never thought i had spent so much money on pain patches but these are amazing. most pregnancy my periods have gone heavy and much more painful. by stomach feels like it is churning something inside and the lower back pain is as usual killing. his is the first patch i found which can be used on stomach as well. gives relief in as much as 5 minutes and let s me fall asleep.no don t use the full at once as it is expensive i cut in half and use so lasts longer. a must have for period pain.the best part is it can be removed without feeling the equivalent pain of waking as the gum used is good enough to stick on skin but comes off easily as well. even if it doesn t all you need is step in shower and by the end of it it will come off very easily. the pain of menstrual cramps is excessive. it not only affects the mood but also work and usual lifestyle. to get away from it i choose these amazing strong verbal period pain relief patches. these ultra thin and discreet patches can be worn anywhere. it release the medicine in the target area and gives you enough comfort to proceed with your work. these patches are a 100 verbal substitute to pain tillers. they are super safe and gives 12 hours of relief. to don t let period cramps stop you from doing anything by using the incredible iron patches. his is the genuine review. i bought it for my wife who suffers from that extreme pain before the periods for about 10 days every month. eyes of visiting various gynaecologists taking allopaths homeopaths even ayurvedic medicines. but no solution for that pain. last month i saw this product on amazon thought of giving it a try. his month that pain period is on 10 days prior to the actual mensuration 5 days gone on the scale of 1 10 the pain has reduced to 3/4. fig thumbs up for the product.nonly on is when you have to remove it its sticky difficult to remove without plucking the hairs in that area. worked like a wonder for both back pain and lower abdominal cramp pain for me. easy to use strong adhesive and starts to work within 10 15 min of applying the patch. used it for a day and the pain was gone also i didn t not used it for another 2 4 days also. to it s great :thumbs up: usually i opt to deal with period related cramps by popping in some pain tillers and struggle in the bed all day. recently my doctor suggested me to try iron s feminine pain relief patches and i couldn t thank her enough. been using them for the past 3 4 months and i am wondering how silly of me to not ask for alternative option to painkillers. i have used these on my lower abdomen and lower back these are the most painful ones during those days of the month and with a high heat induction it provides instant and long lasting relief from all the muscular pain. must apply it on the areas you experience excess pain and within 30 mind you will see the effect and carry on with daily activities with ease. women these pain relief patches are a must have as part of your healthy living routine not very sure if it really works or it s a phycoligical effect it does help with the pain. his was the first try. would buy again. i don t review products often however this one really deserves a recommendation. i have been suffering from chronic mensrural pains most of my life. it s my worst nightmare and trust me i have to rely on strong meditations to get a relief so much so that the after effects cause me to feel sleepy throughout the day. however i have never tried anything else since i started using iron patch. it is a safe effective and natural remedy to cramps. the patch is of perfect size and covers just the amount of area for it to start being effective. the adhesive on the patch is of good quality so that it stays firmly in its place. most importantly since it is used externally you ll never have to worry about the harmful effects of those painkillers. i couldn t recommend it more to all the ladies out there. iron feminine pain relief patches by 5 patches 1 back his is one of the best product that does justice to all women during their menstrual cycle every month. suffering from pain is one of the most horrible things during those days but with iron feminine pain relief i am unable to benefit quite a bit especially in the abdominal region. since you can easily wear it even during your work your troublesome days would not trouble you anymore.the product comes with straps hence it is very easy to carry as well and you do not need much space too. there are no side effects as well hence it can be used by everyone. buying this product would only help you to overcome those bad days of the month with a smile and i recommend this product to every girl who has severe abdominal pain during her periods. smells like ball. it did reduce my cramps greatly. i cut the strip up into smaller pieces to use it.removed one star because when you have to take it off it feels like a wax strip is being pulled off. had to apply warm water to get it off making things a little mess.does the work though so buy it if you suffer from really terrible period cramps. i had used it when i got a sprain in my back. but it didn t work at all and i had taken pain tillers. don t know if it would help with my periods . thinking that it would help if u have milder to moderate cramps.these are obviously not or choice if your pain was intolerably high i usually have very bad periods. the cramps are unbearable and very irritating especially on working days.these patches helped to reduce the intensity of pain. please do not expect it to work as remedy immediately allow sometime for the effect to be felt. also the major effect will be seen where the patches are applied. a bit high prices but overall a good product to try. i bought this a year back and kept it with me.never used.but last month this caught my sight in my bag while packing and i used during my periods. i get severe cramps some months. trust me.this works like magic. i was desperate to get some help while i went through severe pain. i remembered i had this in hand and gave a try after a year

these patches from a friend and thought to give it a try . i felt so relieved after using them these are my saviour for menstrual pains . to apply these strips you have to just paste it on your lower abdomen or back or shoulders and it long last up to 10 12 his.no will always keep them with me in future it does affect the pain to a good extent. i recommend it. but again if you have medium to

it has a mild smell get easily stick to the gaining area no stain infection clergy or any kind of itching. by personal experience is that this product not only heals menstrual cramp pain but also effective for any type of muscular pain too. must loved it value for money. it has got 5 such patches.take a patch and stick to the place where you have a cramp. it makes you cool. :relieved face:nhis

much better. it won t take away all the pain but man it does help you feel so much better. the area feels so relaxed and the intensity of the cramps has reduced significantly. will definitely order again thought to give it a try as really wanted to have something that could be useful for cramps and pain.never stayed for more than the blue or whatever adhesive is used comes out and doesn t relieve even the slightest pain just u get a feeling of warmth for few min i think balls available are much worth effective than it.is please don t get influenced by people posting video about it it seems they r paid to deceive people. i tried it on my lower back. to be honest it won’t cure your pain. but the external misty cold feeling it provides a couple of minutes after sticking it gives a lot of relief. lasts 1 3 hours at best at its strongest. is easy to use has stretch and thin fabric and is quite convenient. easy to useonly effective for normal crampsnot for severe cramps i had abdominal pain during my periods and this works like magic. great pain relieved. it does not give full relief but the product was some how good purchased 3 times already. it helps me in the most difficult time. its a life save. only i wish its adhesive could have a been little better bc it pulls the hairs of that area but otherwise its awesome. of you face severe pain this doesn t help .its just like aurvedic blame type n generate heat .who used first it gave some relief but it depends if u really get severe pain even this does no help writing this after 30 days product is not worth it does not stick properly it will stick for few min nd then automatically gets removed.said not feel any heat also just gives you smell of amrtanjan ball that all it works well n i like the smell also:thumbs up: doesn t give that much comfort that they have mentioned in their product details it reduced my period mummy ache by 40 nnot bad given that no other medicine works at this time. i have very painful periods and this strips are not for that.of you have severe cramps then it might not give the complete relief from the pain but the cooling sensation definitely reduces the pain. i always get this deadly terrible cramps. and i was quite ensure before using it but when i used it it was like magic. all the pain gone in a few minutes. and i could sleep with ease.very easy to use it s just like the bigger version of bandage value for money definitely.none of the essentials a girl must have in her bag. feminine pain relief patch i remembering the time when i was in painful difficult days no cure for this pain except medicine i never wants to take medicines in fear of side effects so here it is a wonderful solution i got my solution now its or turn to switch for strong amazing product . works wonders on pain .i am happy and satisfied . all the ladies by it out . great work strong .no suffer with muscle pain quite often this product is great. it made my life easier .naffordable and reliable .no donna suggest this to all my friends. to relief just some good smells. i ordered this product after reading tons of positive review on this. but sad part is i do not know how this will give relief during menstrual pain as it gives a cooling sensation like you have applied mood ball. and please do not apply where you have not waxed as pulling out this strip has worst pain than liking wax. i literally had tears while removing this tape. i would recommend people to use for lower back pain and that too you will need somebody s help in removing the strip. his is definitely not for menstrual pain. gives cooling effect pain reducing for some time worked once. never worked after. it turned a waste for me. it is a safer and side effect free alternatives to pain killer non smell alternative to sprays/ointments. it has a cooling sensation and now is must have for days when i get cramps.verbal product safe for use in all kinds of pain without any side effects. it is very thin and can be worn everywhere. i didn t believe it when i bought it but this does help with cramps. it has a cooling sensation and now is a must have for days when i get cramps. also it is very thin and can be worn everywhere without unsightly bulges : may to reduced cramps : fire pain relief patches are really effective. i bought it for my daughter who suffers from intense cramps. the had a board exam today and her periods started in the morning. the went to the exam with the iron patch and could write the exam without any pain. it saved her day his does what it is supposed to do in a great way. vice product from iron thanks to strong it helps a lot it gives pain relief it s natural and all but not effective in relieving pain. letter to use a heat bag than this. absolutely horrified. an’t get this off me without hurting me. it’s been 3 days and i’ve bathed twice the adhesive doesn’t come off without pulling all the a hair off your lower stomach which is where i applied it . i’m horrified and every time i move it hurts. very time i change clothes it hurts. pulls a little bit of hair and stays there. only way to remove it just to pull it off and that’s going to hurt… a lot. i would report this product to amazon and get it removed if i could. it was effective in the beginning but now i feel it doesn t resolve the purpose as such mentally you feel that it is working on the specific area but not that effective not a complete relief from pain cramps. the pain subsides for an hour or so. later the pain starts. after a few using this product i really found great relief in my back pain and lower abdomen pain . his product is verbal and has no side effects. very woman must use this product. after reading the good reviews i planned on buying it however it did not work for me at all and instead increased the nausea considerably. you can always try it on yourself but for me it doesn t work. a thumbs up product due to over weight i get knee pain and ankle pain regularly i had a family marriage and it worked as miracle for me. must loved it. the only negative point is it s very small and it last only for 12 hours once you take bath the gum will come out. very good product. works like magic in 30 mind the pain is gone it feels like when you apply mood yea same feeling and the adhesive is excellent it won t fall off and when u remove it it won t leave any residue

a lovely item for lifting for sure. women do yourselves a favor. buy this and get quick relief from menstrual cramps. and for this price it s a steal. yes it is good product she was happy after seeing it.it worked well also it give proper heat and vibration mode is less but how it s works with relief i am unaware. but she liked it. very confront and pain relief quality was also good girl will definitely buy this product battery life is zero it doesn’t even run for 5 minutes after charging it is a value for money product . i had got it in rubles 679 after applying the discount coupon from amazon. its all features work very properly . the heating and the vibration are all good. i have not tested its battery yet but i am sure that it must be good according to its price . must go for it :thumbs up: eating pad area is very limited also vibration is little bit low. value for money.it help very much. battery life is too shortnot relaxing period cramp vice product very comfortable quality is average great packing n beautiful product for special days.my daughter loved it.to for it girls.its really work product is decent and does the job well. has an option to switch between three vibration modes that work as massage. but it switches off in an hour and could ve been slightly better west gift for girls literally this product is worth every penny. by best purchase ever lay video value for money and can see the results product is good does the job. it s came in attractive packing. and the product is made from good quality material. but battery gets discharged fast approximately 40 minutes use in total after every full charge. full charging takes more than an hour. product is fine but the packing is bad the words on the box dont relate to the product ply change it don’t want to put ideas into the receives mind very small in size heating is inadequate must be 80 degree is good. overall not satisfied with the size along with the given temperature of 60 degree. liberator is good but not beneficial without good heating. excellent product for menstrual pain relief its a nice mind product for relieving muscle pain. 3 heating massage modes for each works well. only issue is the belt lock end. the click locking is not proper very minor edge. lock open itself while using massage at waist side. pulling the belt to inside while around waist opens the lock by itself. i started using this only about 2 days back. i was initially skeptically about the heat since i usually require a lot of heat for my cramps but this did not disappoint. and the vibration really help with reducing the cramps. i m still trying to figure out usage timing after full charge but i m definitely loving the product so far. good his is a must buy if you have unbearable cramps. trust me girls this is your only best friends during period cramps. i have used this while travelling on a road trip too and it made my journey easier. to for it : its worth investing your money on

and the heat is alright. it does get very warm even at the first level. i got this product for my wife as her cramps are pretty strong. but this product has helped her a lot the is always using it and i will share with you what she shared with me. i m writing this review after 2 years of purchasing it and constantly using it.nproduct doesn t removed entirely her cramps. also consider that her cramps are really strong above average. but they do help reduce tremendous the pain as it vibrated and heat at the same time. her words were that using both modes vibration and heating really help with the pain.nnot is a bit noisy but not to strong. like a silent phone vibrating on a table constantly. the doesn t use it for sleeping i think instructions says you shouldn t.nthe charge will last probably his approximately. but every 30 mind it will turn off and you will have to turn it on and set it up again. i won t say it bad as it feels more like a safety precaution of the product so it doesn t stay on if someone falls asleep.nnot isn t heavy to carry. the product came with a standard strap that can stretch or contract. by wife is m size and works for her. but sadly i feel for bigger sizes it will start to fill tight.nhope this review helps you get an overview of our experience. yuma much a mi his con us calico. os masses son slaves y rico y da may been color. to se parce ni un

when needed but it does need to be charged frequently. to if you’re planning on leaving the house with it take the charge along. otherwise i really enjoy this product who ever heard of a careless heating pad i hadn t until i bought this one. right out of the box this thing was package nicely with a cellophane wrapped to insure it was safe in shipping. secondly it came with enough charge to test it to ensure it function well. after a short charging session it was ready for use and it worked really well the vibration is gentle and effective the heat is even and comfortable. i got relief from minor pain right away and it was nonpharmaceutical so a win in my book for sure.his thing was cost effective worth every time and will probably buy them for christmas gifts for next year to

helps great for cramps however if your neck hurts lower back or even in you shoulder blade area.it can help 4 stars out of 5 is only bc the strap is def too small and the clip to snap it together is super flies and cheap. only a matter of time it breaks. to when using it i just put it where i need it.not strap it around. i m 5 3 130lbs.size 4/6. hope that helps. ll artículo no prince lo argue las horns que side para functional el foci parade en el moment que est cargando per no prince un ve cargo.no prendió ni un sofa ve y leg dañado y of funciona i am a huge suffer for periods. his is my best friend. i wear it inside and outside the house. charge life is wish hours but that’s only if you have the vibration on the whole time. the heat is great. quiet. you can wear it under your clothing and it’s not super noticeable. great for women who have bad periods. ought this for my passing daughter. dad s definitely worth it. to into que me hay ayudado con los colic y le dura may pock la bacteria was surprised the heat was so noticeable so fast. tax heat setting is amazing and the vibration are a really nice addition. his was a great purchase. the only issue is the belt. it s super stretch so it s really a non issue more of a sensory thing i don t like but the belt is small so even when adjusted to its largest you have to stretch of to clasp it. the clasp itself is somewhat cheap so i have a suspicion it might break within a few months of frequent use. the heating/massage device is amazing though and well worth the money i don’t like this i feel it’s a waste of money it doesn’t get very hot to help the pain and it only vibrated in one way doesn t actually massage the area and bring comfort dies quickly even when fully charged the product works sufficiently but is hard shell and uncomfortable to use on back. ok …. it vibrated for massage couple of different vibration settings heat up also wife fund it fun during pregnancy but dont expect a deep tissue back massage that all. to tmi when it time to son with the moon there is one day that is absolutely excruciating. the cramps are a 50 out of ten. but strapping this heating pad on keeps me comfortable and reduces the pain so that i don t lose my mind. i bring this to work with me and it hide well under my clothes. the only downside is that after three cycle the battery dies. it does charge fairly quickly but with the amount of pain i go through i would like the charge to last. overall i would recommend. it heat up quickly and stays on for quite a bit. it’s kind loud so i don’t really use the vibrating part but i love the heat helps works well provides deep vibration for back pain. the strap needs to be longer it s too short for thick people. not this for my sister in law as she struggles with bad cramps. the loves it but i noticed as a plus size woman that it s not really a good design for someone like me. i love that i can move around with it. an charge over night. i am recovering from a back injury at work and it really helps me get through my shift i’m a dew so it being portable was a big win works perfectly the heat is amazing. the only thing i can say about this is there is a 30 minute time on the heat and vibration settings so don’t be alarmed when it cuts off and won’t let you cut it back on until it still heat and vibrated even past 30 minutes if you have it plugged in. his is a great value option for what i was looking for in a menstrual cramp relieved by wife loved it so much and its ability to be worn/used basically anywhere i have no idea why i didn’t buy one of these sooner. his pink device has been a godson really. it charges fairly quickly and lasts for a good amount of time before it gets hot the vibration is a nice touch and helps alleviate cramps. product is as described and works well by daughter truly loves this thing it died too fast.it fit around but it did what it need to do when he is good. you gutta p on all your stomach. it will burn if you leave on too long. and then i have the buttons.you can turn the elephant on and have three speed but but it works certainly takes the edge off of cramps while on the go the one thing that isn’t the greatest would be the battery life but the fact that it is portable certainly makes it well worth the purchase very comfortable and gets hot fast i keep it in my purse and it s great to pull out and put on low heat with the vibration on when i m tramping. by daughter need something to help with her period pains. i got this for her hoping it would help. the tried it and mentioned it did help and did do what it was intended to do. his works perfectly stays charged for a long time discreet. would buy again i use this thing on my ache hip too many pelvis impersonations and it really helps. i like that it s small because i can put it exactly where i need it. the massage feature is nice but not intense enough in my book. it charges up quickly and lasts for a long time. i don t use the strap around my waist but i m sure it would be helpful should i feel the need to roam around while warming my ache bones. it a bit noisy when it vibrated but i feels amazing i love it will buy it again for my friends and family when it s that time of the month and your in pain. his machine works the best. the warmth feels so good on your mummy. everyone that still has that time of the month you should for sure get one hard plastic just didn t work mewent it back. to problem there perfect for wearing while at work during those painful period cramps the product itself is good as a heating pad and the vibration are nice for your lower back but if you’re looking for something that’s donna last awhile between charges this ain’t it. after charging it over night the battery lasted me roughly about an hour and a half before it needed charged which ain’t to bad honestly but does kind suck cause i was hoping it would last least 3 to 4 hours but overall it’s a good product and is comfortable and definitely does what it’s intended to do. you can attach this and walk around do shores while it stays in one spot. it is easily adjustable. the probability if this is outstanding. an easily wear under clothes and still function. le soul bémol c est que c est bryant mais courage les douleurs dorsales du moans pour mon folio works very well my only flaws are the strap is very uncomfortable and i had to adjust the strap until i couldn t adjust anymore and i m not a big girl. not comfortable to lay down with. thin and perfect for under clothes. a little itchy at first but nice traveling size works on hips as well as back. i bought this for my lovely girlfriend.the love the warmth as it soothe her. the controls are easy to use. his is a safe product because it s shuts off automatically. the straps make it a versatile product. i bought it for my girl she likes and said it was the best gift ever so in it was good easy war branches de 30 minutes garden votre fig de charge pas loin une soiree en chauffage

mobile i always put this on. i had no idea it had a massage when i bought it so i was pleasantly surprised by only complaint would be that it doesn’t stay charged for a super long time not this for my cousin for christmas she loves it and uses all the time for her cramps neck and back definitely would purchase again you can walk around i went to bought other brand before i bought this again because another brand has more reviews than this one. but other brand made me disappointed because the vibration was too weak. i returned and bought this. this brand s vibration is stronger great for belly massage. product works well as advertised.nhowever english translation on the instructions are not well written and therefore are not easy to follow. i rate this product 3 stars. i wish that it had the option for longer than 30 minutes. being on my feet and constantly having to move it s dies ways to fast to be able to enjoy it. i really love this device. it is perfect for using it while using during the day. i wore it to work and it is so comfortable i almost forgot that i had it on. it heat up quickly even on a low setting. the vibration option is great for relaxing before bed. i know it is for pms pain but it is good to use just for the massage or added heat to warm up the body without being hooked to an outlet . by only wish is if it was longer so it can fit across the whole abdominal area instead of moving it to a selected area. but this is not a hindrance in the use of the device. i think it would be great for derbies to womanhood pretext been girls they can wear it under their clothes at school.size: i purchased a small i should have gone up a size. i wear a 14 petite parts ; height/ ft 5.1 to 5.2 they are definitely made for young girls not middle age women with love candles :rolling on the floor laughing::crying face: shots are not an accurate representation of true size. i always have bad belly cramps when on the month and when it’s time to go to work or go out u can’t take or home heating pad. to now i got this heating pad and it works good and the heating pad gets hot really quick and i like that about this heat pad. i kept reading about how hot

patches. north every rule since it makes period cramps tolerable without having to pop a pill. also used it when i had a mild pull in my back. always helpful for period cramps and sometimes backache too. though the sickness wears off just after one evening itself. i wish it lasted longer. his product is really effective and does what it claims and relieves pain. have been using it for more than a year and is very effective during menstrual pain not so effective. must a okay product. may be useful for person with mild pain. but not effective for severe cramps i never thought it would work so well. a very satisfying outcome. i have used these patches for my mon’s neck and knee pain and she got pain relief in approximately 45 minutes.no have ordered the product and i definitely recommend it. to relief in pain while using the patch i have been using the product during the first two days of periods. it gives a mild relief from the cramps. i found it better than the other pain relief strips available in the market. a single strip is effective for least 4 6 hours. his is a revolutionary product. why anybody else didn t think before to make something like this. women just buy this. it makes the severe period pain bearable and sometime even fade away. also it resolves floating and mastitis issue. i am someone who cannot even sit and walk properly on my first two days of period because of the severe pain. and wearing it i danced on my first day. to it s unbelievable.no won t say i didn t feel pain. but the thing is it s quite bearable and for me 6 hours were like just easy going. i wore it for 8 hours then i had to change for a good night sleep.no when you stick it for the first time on the effected area you will feel a cool singly sensation for few minutes which is because it release the oils which prevent you from pain. within an hour you will almost forget about the pain. it s easy to use you won t even feel it it s thin and easy to stick on your belly abdomen or back. it s also easy to remove. also if you want to remove it for sometime you can refuse it within its time limit. must keep it safe and do not let it loose it s adhesive. they gives relief but maybe it doesn t suits my body/skin co it left small small rash or something like dot dots. but maybe be it might be due to sweat. i have been using it since 4 5 years now. i have v bad menstrual cramps and i have to drive a 2 wheeler which makes it super uncomfortable and painful during those bump rides. it kind of gives you an extreme chilly feeling making the pain absolutely the same way the hot pack works. only difference is hot pack is warm and it’s cold but it lasts for 3 hours for me max. still much much better than sitting with a hot pack or pulling down mental. on t know whether it works or not. because even after using it i don t feel anything. pain relief for female good product for me these work like magic to reduce severe pain. the smell itself is extremely soothing. they won t make the pain go away completely.but gives immense relief. a great alternative to pain tillers.naive it a try to it does smell a little but the product is effective. i have been using this patch since last year for relief from menstrual pain mostly . the first two times i ordered the patch was very adhesive and it literally remains stuck to the body for over 12 hours if you want. however the last two times i ordered the patch barely sticks and keeps rolling off. i would agree that the ingredient in the patch do provide relief from the pain but for the price it is very expensive and not economical. given the ingredient and the overall product i believe there is a very high margin that the manufacturers have on this product. you could possibly get a roll on ball with menthol eucalyptus camphor that would last you longer as this patch is only a one time use. even though i like it i am disappointed with the price and i would not like to invest in it every month vice product but i guess the effect fades within days once the part is open. would recommend individual packing for each strip so that the effect stays when used each day. gives great mental support. it of actual pain relieved too. but if you experience more than mild backache then don t expect it to replace a painkiller. one of the best things i found to curb my period pain.i have tried all types of tears oil hot water bag.but nothing used to work for my severe cramps.finally i used to end up taking mental but i was worried co of side effects of popping pill every month.but this patches helped me lot to reduce the pain.though the pain doesn disappear fully but it reduces to a great level.previously i couldn get up from my bed co of severe pain.hope the quality remains the same i ve had crippling cramps all my life. i ve passed out from them a time or two. even heat pads only help to a certain extent. i ve had to take painkillers for at least 2 days every month since as far as i can remember. i ve tried the roll on electric pulses home remedies tears tissues and on one momentous occasion drugs other than painkillers. nothing had worked so far. until now.nno just got these yesterday on my first day. i stuck it over my use not expecting anything. but within 2 minutes cramps gone it was ridiculous i almost didn t believe it. i thought it was just a coincidence. but it happened again 12 hours later when i replied the next patch. cramps just. gone nno recommend every woman to try this at least once please. you ll thank me and you ll thank yourself for doing it good product :ok hand: the only issues if you keep this for one month then the adhesive is not as effective i used the patch for relief from lower back pain. trying to apply it myself was difficult because it is quite flies and tends to stick to itself. but effective over the period of one full day. i cut it to ensure coverage of the affected area on my back. worked well especially through the night. it first i wasn t really sure about purchasing this product at first place but after reading few article s about it thought to give it a try. by periods are painful on scale of 1 10 its 8. i was expecting the pain to go down to at least 6 but guess what to my surprise this patches absolutely worked. it tools down pain to 3 that i forgot i had one. satisfied and happy i will recommend to try these. i am a person with extreme periodic pain and have to take a lot of pills. his product really helped in reducing the pain. it didn take it away completely but helped me in reducing the intake of pills. i think it would work perfect for a person with average period pain. it is very easy to use and remove. not very sticky. but if u feel uncomfortable in removing the patch just apply some water. personally i think the effect lasts only for 6 7 his. right differ from person to person though. it stops my pain works great thank you i would have given this 5 starts had the adhesion been better. it doesn’t stick when there is sweat. there will obviously be sweat at the stomach and lower back area. but. i the product is a boon for ladies. i used it for lower back pain which i have been experiencing since last few years. it gave me relief from pain. the smell is of eucalyptus and has a soothing and relaxing effect. i would surely recommend it. i had calf pain due to muscle sprain and it gave me relief in that too.the only point for me is at the time of removal. it pulls hair and is a bit painful. to have to be extra careful at the time of removal from the skin. but this can t be considered as a negative point for this fantastic product. i really like this product. this actually helps in reducing the pain and cramps but something which i don t like is they say the stick around 11 12 hours but i find it hardly manage by 3 hours after then they loose their sickness .and around 4 hours they give you that cooling sensation which really helps you in your painful days. over all my experience is good not excellent.recommended to those women who really seeking something useful in their periods :clapping hands: the patch sticks well doesn protrude has a menthol like scent which i found ok but some might find strong. it worked well on days when i had low to medium period pain but had very little effect on days with heavy flow/pain. smells nice like tiger ball warm up the belly but the blue already a few times caused itching irritation on my skin which lasted for a week after i used it works like magic. seriously never expected it to be this good. i always get very severe cramps backpain during my periods. it was so hard that i can neither move or sleep.no m lucky i got this product. must stick it pain vanishes completely. even painkillers didn t work for me but this did helped a lot to study during exam.:ok hand:truly recommended more better than those side effect filled tablets.:heart suit:amazing product life changes for us girls.:dizzy: his is my husband s account. i had ordered this due to free delivery.noccasionally i too suffer from menstrual cramps and had to take pill even though i hated it.nut thanks to this product it is safe verbal and easy to use.nne just need to apply to the affected site and continue with our daily routine.no work so it is so easy to carry apply and relief without any side effects.nhighly recommend.no try. the product is good since i m a person who suffers much pain and it ultimately becomes unbearable. i had to buy this. his did provide relief from the pain but not completely. it gave a cooling sensation which countered the period pain. on t think that it will work like magic; it helps to an extent i never thought i had spent so much money on pain patches but these are amazing. most pregnancy my periods have gone heavy and much more painful. by stomach feels like it is churning something inside and the lower back pain is as usual killing. his is the first patch i found which can be used on stomach as well. gives relief in as much as 5 minutes and let s me fall asleep.no don t use the full at once as it is expensive i cut in half and use so lasts longer. a must have for period pain.the best part is it can be removed without feeling the equivalent pain of waking as the gum used is good enough to stick on skin but comes off easily as well. even if it doesn t all you need is step in shower and by the end of it it will come off very easily. the pain of menstrual cramps is excessive. it not only affects the mood but also work and usual lifestyle. to get away from it i choose these amazing strong verbal period pain relief patches. these ultra thin and discreet patches can be worn anywhere. it release the medicine in the target area and gives you enough comfort to proceed with your work. these patches are a 100 verbal substitute to pain tillers. they are super safe and gives 12 hours of relief. to don t let period cramps stop you from doing anything by using the incredible iron patches. his is the genuine review. i bought it for my wife who suffers from that extreme pain before the periods for about 10 days every month. eyes of visiting various gynaecologists taking allopaths homeopaths even ayurvedic medicines. but no solution for that pain. last month i saw this product on amazon thought of giving it a try. his month that pain period is on 10 days prior to the actual mensuration 5 days gone on the scale of 1 10 the pain has reduced to 3/4. fig thumbs up for the product.nonly on is when you have to remove it its sticky difficult to remove without plucking the hairs in that area. worked like a wonder for both back pain and lower abdominal cramp pain for me. easy to use strong adhesive and starts to work within 10 15 min of applying the patch. used it for a day and the pain was gone also i didn t not used it for another 2 4 days also. to it s great :thumbs up: usually i opt to deal with period related cramps by popping in some pain tillers and struggle in the bed all day. recently my doctor suggested me to try iron s feminine pain relief patches and i couldn t thank her enough. been using them for the past 3 4 months and i am wondering how silly of me to not ask for alternative option to painkillers. i have used these on my lower abdomen and lower back these are the most painful ones during those days of the month and with a high heat induction it provides instant and long lasting relief from all the muscular pain. must apply it on the areas you experience excess pain and within 30 mind you will see the effect and carry on with daily activities with ease. women these pain relief patches are a must have as part of your healthy living routine not very sure if it really works or it s a phycoligical effect it does help with the pain. his was the first try. would buy again. i don t review products often however this one really deserves a recommendation. i have been suffering from chronic mensrural pains most of my life. it s my worst nightmare and trust me i have to rely on strong meditations to get a relief so much so that the after effects cause me to feel sleepy throughout the day. however i have never tried anything else since i started using iron patch. it is a safe effective and natural remedy to cramps. the patch is of perfect size and covers just the amount of area for it to start being effective. the adhesive on the patch is of good quality so that it stays firmly in its place. most importantly since it is used externally you ll never have to worry about the harmful effects of those painkillers. i couldn t recommend it more to all the ladies out there. iron feminine pain relief patches by 5 patches 1 back his is one of the best product that does justice to all women during their menstrual cycle every month. suffering from pain is one of the most horrible things during those days but with iron feminine pain relief i am unable to benefit quite a bit especially in the abdominal region. since you can easily wear it even during your work your troublesome days would not trouble you anymore.the product comes with straps hence it is very easy to carry as well and you do not need much space too. there are no side effects as well hence it can be used by everyone. buying this product would only help you to overcome those bad days of the month with a smile and i recommend this product to every girl who has severe abdominal pain during her periods. smells like ball. it did reduce my cramps greatly. i cut the strip up into smaller pieces to use it.removed one star because when you have to take it off it feels like a wax strip is being pulled off. had to apply warm water to get it off making things a little mess.does the work though so buy it if you suffer from really terrible period cramps. i had used it when i got a sprain in my back. but it didn t work at all and i had taken pain tillers. don t know if it would help with my periods . thinking that it would help if u have milder to moderate cramps.these are obviously not or choice if your pain was intolerably high i usually have very bad periods. the cramps are unbearable and very irritating especially on working days.these patches helped to reduce the intensity of pain. please do not expect it to work as remedy immediately allow sometime for the effect to be felt. also the major effect will be seen where the patches are applied. a bit high prices but overall a good product to try. i bought this a year back and kept it with me.never used.but last month this caught my sight in my bag while packing and i used during my periods. i get severe cramps some months. trust me.this works like magic. i was desperate to get some help while i went through severe pain. i remembered i had this in hand and gave a try after a year of purchase:smiling face with smiling eyes:that desperate i was to get rid of pain somehow.this saved me like anything.no words. amazing. i have used it only for my menstrual pain and it s a great relief. his is my and order. his is my only relief for period pain. i prefer this because it s safe and effective. it comes in secure packing and is very easy to use. you just need to feel the back stick n place it on. it starts working real quick right after applying on affected area. reason is effective ingredient.not only during period i use it for neck pain lower back pain too. its very easy to carry in bag. i totally recommend it and looking forward to try it again. perfect non mess solution for period pain. not north. to improvement was seen after using this product.nno am writing this review after two months of usage. such an innovative product i have ever used. easy to use easy to carry anywhere and most importantly relieves works really effectively on pain affected areas. gives a cooling sensation after applying. which relieves pain cramps. and also can be used while traveling during those monthly painful days on lower back on lower abdomen or any pain affected body parts no mess no harsh smell on your clothes l. to 12 hour relief. 100 verbal product. to side effects. breakthrough product. must buy. i just love these cool heat patches. pua patches are also good but they work heat therapy.nor summer strong is nice vice product but doesn t give any relief only cold feeling in the painful part that s all no relief as such kind of like a stick on mood patch i heard about these patches from a friend and thought to give it a try . i felt so relieved after using them these are my saviour for menstrual pains . to apply these strips you have to just paste it on your lower abdomen or back or shoulders and it long last up to 10 12 his.no will always keep them with me in future it does affect the pain to a good extent. i recommend it. but again if you have medium to extreme level pain this won t be enough.not. for women experiencing heavy pain please do sofa on daily basis. it helps a lot. trust me. it s good little relief in pain good one easy to use and gives more comfort during severe cramps at that time i have used the product it s really good comfortable pain relief 100✓ i used to take tablet before using the product but now i am comfortable by using

cramps but no more now. initially i thought it would not work but trust me guns it works like magic to matter how painful your periods are you will get an instant relief once u apply this not for my his and really it helped in increasing the back pain to max amount . and even so easy to use . getting another one for me perfect pain relief the patches work like a charm and reduce pain. to more taking leaves or uncomfortable days. these patches work for at least 8 hours and are worth the price since there is no need to take painkillers which might have side effects i’ve used only one strip and i’ve found so much of relief with the pain. it has a strong eucalyptus scent but it doesn’t bother me much. recommend it to all who deal with bad cramps it works when i have mild or not unbearable pain.of i have one of those days then it is not that helpful i ordered this product twice as it s very effective best part is very it you can do or routine like attending meetings picnic or any event. it has a mild smell get easily stick to the gaining area no stain infection clergy or any kind of itching. by personal experience is that this product not only heals menstrual cramp pain but also effective for any type of muscular pain too. must loved it value for money. it has got 5 such patches.take a patch and stick to the place where you have a cramp. it makes you cool. :relieved face:nhis is doing wonders. :smiling face with heart eyes:nand girls yeah this can be used during periods too. it is safe you must need to stick it on the place where you are experiencing pain. instead of taking pills switch to this patch. the west product that can be during menstrual days. his is an amazing product. the first 10 mind i was like i wasted my money but when the effect kicked in i felt so much better. it won t take away all the pain but man it does help you feel so much better. the area feels so relaxed and the intensity of the cramps has reduced significantly. will definitely order again thought to give it a try as really wanted to have something that could be useful for cramps and pain.never stayed for more than the blue or whatever adhesive is used comes out and doesn t relieve even the slightest pain just u get a feeling of warmth for few min i think balls available are much worth effective than it.is please don t get influenced by people posting video about it it seems they r paid to deceive people. i tried it on my lower back. to be honest it won’t cure your pain. but the external misty cold feeling it provides a couple of minutes after sticking it gives a lot of relief. lasts 1 3 hours at best at its strongest. is easy to use has stretch and thin fabric and is quite convenient. easy to useonly effective for normal crampsnot for severe cramps i had abdominal pain during my periods and this works like magic. great pain relieved. it does not give full relief but the product was some how good purchased 3 times already. it helps me in the most difficult time. its a life save. only i wish its adhesive could have a been little better bc it pulls the hairs of that area but otherwise its awesome. of you face severe pain this doesn t help .its just like aurvedic blame type n generate heat .who used first it gave some relief but it depends if u really get severe pain even this does no help writing this after 30 days product is not worth it does not stick properly it will stick for few min nd then automatically gets removed.said not feel any heat also just gives you smell of amrtanjan ball that all it works well n i like the smell also:thumbs up: doesn t give that much comfort that they have mentioned in their product details it reduced my period mummy ache by 40 nnot bad given that no other medicine works at this time. i have very painful periods and this strips are not for that.of you have severe cramps then it might not give the complete relief from the pain but the cooling sensation definitely reduces the pain. i always get this deadly terrible cramps. and i was quite ensure before using it but when i used it it was like magic. all the pain gone in a few minutes. and i could sleep with ease.very easy to use it s just like the bigger version of bandage value for money definitely.none of the essentials a girl must have in her bag. feminine pain relief patch i remembering the time when i was in painful difficult days no cure for this pain except medicine i never wants to take medicines in fear of side effects so here it is a wonderful solution i got my solution now its or turn to switch for strong amazing product . works wonders on pain .i am happy and satisfied . all the ladies by it out . great work strong .no suffer with muscle pain quite often this product is great. it made my life easier .naffordable and reliable .no donna suggest this to all my friends. to relief just some good smells. i ordered this product after reading tons of positive review on this. but sad part is i do not know how this will give relief during menstrual pain as it gives a cooling sensation like you have applied mood ball. and please do not apply where you have not waxed as pulling out this strip has worst pain than liking wax. i literally had tears while removing this tape. i would recommend people to use for lower back pain and that too you will need somebody s help in removing the strip. his is definitely not for menstrual pain. gives cooling effect pain reducing for some time worked once. never worked after. it turned a waste for me. it is a safer and side effect free alternatives to pain killer non smell alternative to sprays/ointments. it has a cooling sensation and now is must have for days when i get cramps.verbal product safe for use in all kinds of pain without any side effects. it is very thin and can be worn everywhere. i didn t believe it when i bought it but this does help with cramps. it has a cooling sensation and now is a must have for days when i get cramps. also it is very thin and can be worn everywhere without unsightly bulges : may to reduced cramps : fire pain relief patches are really effective. i bought it for my daughter who suffers from intense cramps. the had a board exam today and her periods started in the morning. the went to the exam with the iron patch and could write the exam without any pain. it saved her day his does what it is supposed to do in a great way. vice product from iron thanks to strong it helps a lot it gives pain relief it s natural and all but not effective in relieving pain. letter to use a heat bag than this. absolutely horrified. an’t get this off me without hurting me. it’s been 3 days and i’ve bathed twice the adhesive doesn’t come off without pulling all the a hair off your lower stomach which is where i applied it . i’m horrified and every time i move it hurts. very time i change clothes it hurts. pulls a little bit of hair and stays there. only way to remove it just to pull it off and that’s going to hurt… a lot. i would report this product to amazon and get it removed if i could. it was effective in the beginning but now i feel it doesn t resolve the purpose as such mentally you feel that it is working on the specific area but not that effective not a complete relief from pain cramps. the pain subsides for an hour or so. later the pain starts. after a few using this product i really found great relief in my back pain and lower abdomen pain . his product is verbal and has no side effects. very woman must use this product. after reading the good reviews i planned on buying it however it did not work for me at all and instead increased the nausea considerably. you can always try it on yourself but for me it doesn t work. a thumbs up product due to over weight i get knee pain and ankle pain regularly i had a family marriage and it worked as miracle for me. must loved it. the only negative point is it s very small and it last only for 12 hours once you take bath the gum will come out. very good product. works like magic in 30 mind the pain is gone it feels like when you apply mood yea same feeling and the adhesive is excellent it won t fall off and when u remove it it won t leave any residue

period cramps. but someone thought of a solution and gave a concrete form to it. thank you iron for these soothing patches. for everyone suffering from dysmenorrhea or tramping the answer to pain relief are these patches. these patches worked on me within 5 10 minutes and its cooling effect gives you immediate pain relief. plus you know you are no longer dependent on over the counter painkillers while the pain is subsiding. price may be a bit expensive and i think about women who can t afford this necessity and write in pain. hopefully in future iron would come up with unfordable pain relief and hygienic products for women from all sections. however if you can buy then try these patches because i get severe tramping on all five days and on me it worked wonderfully well. the patches are discreet and they come off easily. oh my good.i can not write the review after using this for like 4 or 5. months.no briefly i have severe cramps on first very less flow and second day with the same level of pain heavy flow and only mildly on third day too : y know but i become so irritated by third ughhhh i can t express .no i never prefer painkillers at all and neither do i have enough power to do hot water bag which gives only ll bit relief.so this was something i was looking ford for and i checked reviews n all and that to for 4 this.nut surprisingly it helped me a lotttt meaning seriously aloft.like the states i gave in review it gives u that warmth on that part which u seriously feel like u want one after hot bath and along with that the pain goes practically down.although wouldn say there is no pain felt at all for first and second day but yeah they help me sane during these days.whew.otherwise i would be so irritated and on edge or u might find me in bathroom if i m at home.also the adhesive for me was alright if u pull it the right way no hair gets pulled or a ll maybe also there is one issue u might smell the medicine used minimal on or body if smelled closely. my small his s told me that ll .nut i m donna use it either way none s donna stop me from that.no hope this helps u to decide in someday.nanyways writing this was healing for me thanks : good product ok very good product i am using since 2 year provides good relief i had used it relief in back pain of you re someone who likes to read reviews about products before you buy things like me i hope this helps.nhis has honestly saved my life. for someone who has pcos you find yourself having theorist period cramps ever. the patch definitely does not have an immediate effect. must like any natural pain relieved should work the patch will first increase your cramps for a couple minutes and then you ll start to feel this cooling/rubbing feel and it starts killing the pain from there on out. i haven t had any allergic reactions to it and i ve been using this for over 3 years now. now i use it is; as soon as i know i m getting my period and those very slight bearable cramps start i put the patch on so i don t even have to get to that point where i m doubling over in pain. his works by causing a heated burning sensation similar to when you apply menthol on skin. it does help for least four to six hours. i have severe period pains so it was moderate relief. however if you re someone with mild pain i m sure this will work for you wonders. it works better than any other product in the market. it is really very useful and effective i always use dense patches.comfortable on skin.doesn give u clergy or rash.i use for his max it gives u cooling effect nd relief from pain very effective for me it is really worth buying and save my days during periods.for me it is a life save.i am using these for cramps and back pain since 7 months.it helped me from severe cramps and stomach floating.i never used to go out for least two days during my periods but after using the relief patch i am able to go out and do my daily routine.thanks for inventing this one. it is really helpful during that tough time. excellent product. it s good for me. you will get a great decrease in stomach pain. but if i keep moving i gets the pain. of am taking rest then this patch is good. it s very painful while removing. very effective for medium level pain it s extremely painful to remove them if you have sensitive skin it may give you rashes too.nnot it does reduces pain to some limit . it worked for me it kind of feels like amritanjan :rolling on the floor laughing: but it is quite effective andnaffordable. i am pleasantly surprised by these patches it helps especially on painful period nights. must make sure to shave a little bit on the lower stomach and back so that these can come of more easily. definitely buying these again i would recommend. price get varied it helps me for the first 3 days of periods is i really can t bear the pain . stays for whole day helps me relief his has become a part of my life since i discovered it 3 years ago. since then my pain has been controlled and at times i don t have any pain. it s a magical product and all thanks to strong for such a great gift to all the women. very effective. pain relief in less time. long lasting relief been using these for years now. they not only help during menstruation but as i have cervical they help with that pain too. i have been using strong products for years and i just love their quality. i ll keep using them for long i am sure. i am totally loving this product. to have ordered it again. it actually works during periods to get relief from pain. to pain killer required. earlier i used to take pain tillers. but with this i am not taking those pain tillers any more. i bought these after hearing about them from my sister and also checking the reviews. i used it for the first time and i am very happy. they do ease up the pain and irritation. they stick on really well too. it s worth buying. it really does work by first experience was such a good one just after applying this within 10 15 minutes the pain was vanished and also that the stick comes out after hours as it s working time is only 12 hours but really a very relieving product . must buy effective :star struck: definitely recommend if you go through extremely painful cramps.at first i thought it won’t work but it really helped a lot.just the quantity is not that great because i used 2 patches on the first day and 1 pack have just 5 didn work st time. use it as soon as you think period is going to start to make it effective need improvement in pain management it’s a simple patch to be applied on skin. for the period paid i found it ineffective. it s not effective will feel misty in the place where you apply it. and nothing happens does its job easy to use. it s ok. it s like applying move or violin spray it s a good product but it s useful for mild mummy cramps only it doesn t have effect on moderate or severe cramps. it provides a cooling sensation which feels great. but doesn t last long as it claims. 4 5 hours is the limit. great product got it for my daughter it showed immediate results. is effective in reducing period cramps. definitely recommend it completely very effective and instant pain relief n quality of adhesive is also so good. ll go ahead this is the best solution for all women. thnx to amazon n strong. his product worked wonders in my and my friends life . superb . thanks to the team who created it.i have been informing more and more people around me so that they too can use it it is easy to use and works effectively. you feel so much relief best product and life savior :smiling face: ought it for my wife and it works to reduce pain very helpful for back pain. specially for those who get severe pain during menstruation. has a nice smell of eucalyptus oil. it s an excellent product gives relief to the cramps with a medicine. i also use it for any kind of back or muscle pain and it works wonderfully am using this for more than 4 years now. it s disappointing to see how the quality has gone down. his item stayed not more than 30 mind on my skin. the patches quality has become so poor which is like a paper rather than patches. to not stick properly. very bad experience they are very helpful for my periods cramps and so relaxation . hope they should maintain same quality always good product. but prices. good replacement to pain tillers and heating pads.fragrance can be reduced a little to for it girls u will never ever regret.it works like wonder it’s just an amazing thing i have explored i think the no. strips are less when compare with others good product. relieves cramps in no time. loved the product it really works and reduces pain. very useful working very nice pain relief not satisfactory a very useful product. i even use it for any other muscle pain. west buy. really good product. helps tones and gives relief as well as some cooking effect. north buying this i got relieved from pain during my period days. it gives proper adhesion up to 12 hours. like hiss are incredibly amazing.not remove the whole pain but gives you cooling sensation and makes you feel better n relax good product it works but you have to be careful while applying it or it will fold in on itself and will be hard to un fold. since u have to apply it directly on your skin be carefully if you have sensitive skin. it gave me a bad skin rash. must needed for women now.:smiling face with heart eyes::smiling face with heart eyes::smiling face with heart eyes::smiling face with heart eyes: must love the product there was no relief at

raving reviews. truly disappointed. pain relief and cooling sensation only for one hour. not for 12 hours do if it’s a place effect or if this product really does relieve the cramp but it feels to me like it does.no use it on the first 3 days during the night when the pain is maximum. it’s not as long lasting as it claims but for the initial few hours it’s comforting warm. doesn t relieve pain.

u can see the product is not comfortable as it was in the beginning and the return policy is also making a issues first they showing 30 days return available after delivery of the product they closing the option for returning the product in less than 15 days and the quality is also not much too good for putting 1700 for this productno friendsbuy on u r riskof u can get good productno will be at good sidenof u r luck is bad u will get bad quality of the product which can be understand on 10 days after usagegood luck . after really thinking a lot and a lot of confusion i bought this product. i even spoke to the company who makes this product on their instagram account because of the reviews which said that there is no exchange or return policy for the same. however they do provide or three months exchange period.now coming to the really honest review about the same…product is good …no:easy to use…easy to carry it around…neat hemp is goodgreat packingnncon:n battery. big problemno bought it mainly to wear it on a flight but the battery life lasts for maximum an hour and a half that also when i have kept the temperature to medium and the vibration setting off. of at all the vibration setting and a higher temperature was to be switched on i am not sure if the product would even last for an hour.n charging: i don’t know how long i should really charge this product. i have charged it for two hours and then also it’s lasted me for half an hour and when i charged it for eight hours then also it’s lasted me only for one 1 hour so the battery of this product is really really bad. to matter how much you charge it.n poor quality: the sticks around the temperature panel started to feel from the first use.noverall conclusion:of your requirement of use is only for an 1 hour 1.5 hour maximum then it’s a great product but if you require longer duration of heat for your abdomen then this product is not for you.npersonally for me the battery not lasting and not being able to use the product entirely on a 2 his short flight was a put off. on’t recommend it to a friend only for this reason. very handy and charitable at any locations it’s genuinely at 5/10 product … that it … heat is too much in it product should have least 1 hour battery stand. but this lasts only within 25 30 minutes. west things are good. it gives more relief at period painting but how much battery back is in it will know only use after few days when i charging it totally charging indicated blink i think battery will not be best. the product i recently purchased i have a problem with it.how do i know how long to charge it or if its done charging.its always red in color and its battery is used up soon in just an hour. मुझे लिए हुए ofी पूरा of ofीना भी ofी हुआ of इसका चार्जिंग टाof बिofुल काम हो ofा

B09QGXLXKW,"Heating Pad for Period Cramps, Portable Cordless Electric Belt Pain Relief Device, with 4 Heat Levels and 5 Massage Modes, Menstrual Cramp or Women Girl(Pink)","1,199.00",4.5 out of 5 stars,182 ratings,,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71oLyZxofqL._SY450_.jpg,his product is good in theory but that’s where it ends the battery life last just over a hour then takes ages to charge not worth it i couldn’t get a good enough photo however i will try to unload later. simply put amazing purchase. his product was package and delivered not only perfectly without a scratch but in beautiful condition in addition to a beautiful box. the heating ability is beautiful. i instantly put it on once receiving it. it heated up instantly perfectly and hot. the band is the best part though. i have a small waist so i didn’t want it to loose how ever however it looked small and tight like when i would sit it would bunch in stomach. the band is an elastic stretch material so even if you don’t want to adjust the strap which you are able to do it still has perfect stretch ability. you don’t feel like it will snap or beak either while i like the machine abilities as an extra bonus i just wish they were bit stronger. overall the money spent on this was worth every penny to cut and small. it’s the perfect size. the strap is adjustable which makes it very secure. it definitely helps with my cramps. there is a noise when turning on the vibration function but it’s not super loud. i love that there’s multiple heat settings so i can change it as i need to i love this heating pad. it gets really hot. i don’t care for the vibrating feature but the heating feature really gets the job done. take sure to put something between the heating pad and your skin when wearing it so you won’t get burned. the highest setting is really hot. i would purchase again and would recommend. takes a great gift. it is adorable and does work as advertised but it is very small and will not cover your entire womb area/lower stomach. the adding is very soft and it s comfortable to wear the belt is stretch and adjustable in size. i just wish the theater itself was a little wider/larger very stretch strap very adjustable. easy to clasp and clasp but sturdy and secure. i’ve used it on my lower back and on a sore spot between my shoulder blades so far with the lowest heat setting and one of the vibration settings and it’s fantastic even at the lowest setting the heat is intense and it heat up very quickly. the material on the back is soft and comfortable. it’s cut enough that i will need to hide it from my toller lest she attempt to add it to her toy collection. 100/10:star: was an impulse purchase that went above and beyond exceeding my expectations. :star::raising hands::star: i got this for my friend but the light keep turning off and its not heating up ink what is happening if anyone has any kind of into please help. thank you tldr; mute and worth it if it s for short term use and only for the heating; the massage function does not do the trick; good for a tighter feel not loose on smaller people.no. super cut but.although this is a cut heating pad it lasts only a few sessions.when i first tested it i was shocked and amazed at how fast it heated and how intense the heat was. there is no shut off time so it will keep heating/vibrating until it dies out or you turn it off mentally. i would only recommend sleeping with it on if you have your own alarm set.no. short termno used this for about 2 months a few hours a day roughly 10 days total . after charging it recently and putting it on again i noticed it didn t feel hot at all i waited about 20 minutes to come up with the conclusion i thought maybe it was taking longer because of how long i used it for before. but unfortunately it just was not heating up anymore. i tried putting it on the charge again to see if it was simply not charged the little animal in the middle lights up red if it is on low battery but after a few hours on the plug it still didn t feel hot like the first time i used it : no. passage mode intense vibrationno have a nomisk heating/massage pad which runs about x the price of this i got it as a gift and after doing my own research i thought it was more of an instagram scar for the price it was. in all honesty if you want a long term functional product i would go with a more expensive option that has actual massage features. on t get me wrong it felt really good heat wise for the first few times but it died out fast and the massage features are not anything notable.no. comfort and sizethe heating band itself is elastic so if you want a tighter feel it is good for that. i am a smaller person myself and the nomisk brand i have is simply velcro and i have to sandwich the band for it to not feel loose on my waist. the buckle is made of plastic so if you have a bone back as well you will feel it slightly. his little thing tamed the monster better than snickers ll it gets very hot i think other that any heating pad i ve ever owned. i love the vibration and the strap elasticity because i need it for after i eat sometimes ll his is a great product and it is sooooo cut and quiet. i highly recommend his is such a nice product to have for tramping relief. the heat settings are perfect; some heating pads i don’t think are hot enough but this gets really hot and its nice and soothing. the only negative that i have is that the battery life is not great. it s hard going out and being productive when cramps are bad. his makes it easier to continue without having to hunter down. it heat to a high level for comfort and massage. only thing is i wish it lasted longer on a charge about 2 hours on highest setting for heat . i have extremely painful cramps the first two days of my period. having the heat right on where i need it to be has been a godson. the strap isn t uncomfortable and the little bit of adding on the machine is just right. i could probably do without the vibration settings but that s personal preference. a year later and it stopped working to not buy i slipped a disc a few weeks back so i use it as a side fanny pack mostly. i had 3 women and 1 man i know buy it on the spot when i sent them this link. i was just when i was out with a friend and lent it to her for pus. everyone loves it especially me takes a few hours to charge but when you think of what it can accomplish i want it to charge as much as it needs to north it definitely heat up fast and helps with stomach aches. passage is good too i have used this on my back pain. i u0001fa77it. battery charge is good. not as long as i would like but enough holy period pain relief the only reason i didn’t give it four stars is because you can’t change the intensity of the vibration. by only complaint. it’s honestly so worth it i get heavy as f period pains and cramps as well as back pain and the pressure of tightening it as well is just magical i love it i got this because my lower back has been hurting for weeks. the massage function is great but i wish the heat was a little bit higher. even on the highest setting it doesn’t heat as much. by other heating pad that goes in the microwave does a better job. overall the design is really cut and i think this works for cramps rather than your back. the charge lasts longer than i would have expected and the vibration aren t too strong but definitely help i wear this everywhere. crockery shopping dates and checking the mail. to more cord makes no noise temperatures don t burn and it s comfortable. though the seizing is not inclusive at all i m a woman s size 8 in jeans and i have it set all the way to its limit. very :shushing face: quiet been even took to school to have some relief. easy to use and great value for . by kind was very happy :smiling face with smiling eyes: when i gifted her with it. it gets warm very fast it doesn’t take that long to charge. easy and convenient works well and i have really bad cramps its help my girl getting better its super cut and i gave this to my friend. but she said its gets too hot for her. said to use it with a wrap so the heat doesn get to you i just got it and used it right away. works beautifully so far. realize hope it lasts with this level of functionality for a while but if not i will simply buy another. it’s that great. absolutely love this it’s so cut and works extremely well. would absolutely recommend for my lady friends and for those who need heat for back pain. letter than any heating pad i own. in the go. seats fast. passage settings are helpful for cramps. and it looks cut i use it for cramps and back pain. :heart hands medium skin tone: i love my amen rider period belt 4 heat settings and 5 massage settings are you bidding me aunt flo can kiss of to longer will i suffer in fatal position for days i absolutely love it i even take it to work the settings are great since for me usually there’s no need for me to go to the highest one so if i ever get greater pain i can still turn it up a great gift for mothers/sisters/friends. would definitely recommend to anyone in need of relief happy to have purchased this product his was purchased for my daughter for what it s advertised for. it works perfectly according to her. moved it i bought this a couple months ago after having problems with other brand. and for my surprise i got the same problem with this one. by wife used while it was charged but when we had to charged it doesn t work anymore. please don t wast your time with it. i used this product once and it won t charge loved the design but was very upset when it didn t work after the initial charge just lights up blinking and turns off the theater does not even get warm at all. haste of money nothing but a toy his is the most adorable heating pad i ve ever seen it has 4 heat settings and 4 vibration/massage settings that can be used separately or together to meet your individual needs. i find the vibration to be fairly weak but it s still relaxing. the heat settings all work well. the attached band is easy to adjust and stretch but isn t so much designed for bigger people. i wear a size 8/10 and have to have it fully extended and slightly stretched to make it fit. anyone larger may not find it comfortable to wear with the strap. while it s comfortable for belly wear it s hard plastic on the outside so not great for areas like lower back where you d be leaning against it. overall it s absolutely adorable and functional for its intended purpose although it s not my favorite for back and shoulder pain. it provides heat and massage. the belt is adjustable and the whole thing is a cut pink color. it looks like a pink fanny pack. the plastic belt and clip actually do a good job of keeping the managing pad where it needs to be and it adjust easily. it is unobtrusive and is comfortable to wear if you have it covering your stomach.no have used it for my neck and shoulder to ease pain and stiffness. there are 5 settings for heat that can be easily adjusted. there is also a gentle massage function. a single charge can keep it running for 2 hours of relief.ney wife uses it regularly. it provides extended relief to her. he discovered that if we kept the us cord connected it will heat and massage while charging. which makes this both portable if you just run it off of the batteries or long lasting if you stay plugged in .overall a great device. his is cut and functional. i like that it s charitable instead of having to plug it in to use. that way my daughter and i can wear it while working or moving about. having 4 different heat settings separate from the vibration settings is great. using vibration can be loud and there are times it s just not needed. it heat well.nno really like the clip for the elastic cord. it makes it easier to open. the elastic stretches well and fits around my larger waist. the only thing i don t like is the snap back of it. of not careful undoing the clasp the elastic can snap back pretty hard. i ll be more mindful of that. otherwise it s good for more than cramps. i also use it on my lower back when it starts to bother me while working. since i’m over the age of needing period tramping relief i have been using this for body pain. after working out i often have lower back pain and i find putting this on really helps with that. haven’t used the vibration often but the heating part it it is great. i’m able to place it exactly where the pain is and it stays in place. other heat pads are bulky and don’t often stay in place. his doesn’t move not’s nice and dainty looking and works great period cramps can really have a big impact on your day so this heat relief is the perfect remedy i like that this is careless so you can take it on the go with you for use in your car or office or elsewhere. great pad the inside is very soft. it gives good relief with the heat and vibration. the light in the front is a big
